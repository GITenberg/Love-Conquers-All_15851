<h1 class="tei tei-head">I.—THE BENCHLEY-WHITTIER CORRESPONDENCE</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Old scandals concerning the private life of Lord
Byron have been revived with the recent
publication of a collection of his letters. One of
the big questions seems to be: <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Did Byron send Mary
Shelley&#39;s letter to Mrs. R.B. Hoppner</span>? Everyone
seems greatly excited about it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Lest future generations be thrown into turmoil
over my correspondence after I am gone, I want right
now to clear up the mystery which has puzzled
literary circles for over thirty years. I need
hardly add that I refer to what is known as the
"Benchley-Whittier Correspondence."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The big question over which both my biographers
and Whittier&#39;s might possibly come to blows is this,
as I understand it: <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Did John Greenleaf Whittier ever
receive the letters I wrote to him in the late Fall
of</span> 1890? <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">If he did not, who did? And under
what circumstances were they written</span>?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I was a very young man at the time, and Mr.
Whittier was, naturally, very old. There had been
<span class="tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a meeting of the Save-Our-Song-Birds Club in old
Dane Hall (now demolished) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Members had left their coats and hats
in the check-room at the foot of the stairs (now
demolished).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In passing out after a rather spirited meeting,
during the course of which Mr. Whittier and Dr.
Van Blarcom had opposed each other rather violently
over the question of Baltimore orioles, the aged poet
naturally was the first to be helped into his coat.
In the general mix-up (there was considerable good-natured
fooling among the members as they left,
relieved as they were from the strain of the
meeting) Whittier was given my hat by mistake.
When I came to go, there was nothing left for me
but a rather seedy gray derby with a black band,
containing the initials "J.G.W." As the poet was
visiting in Cambridge at the time I took opportunity
next day to write the following letter to him:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">Cambridge, Mass.<br />
November 7, 1890.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Whittier:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I am afraid that in the confusion following the
Save-Our-Song-Birds meeting last night, you were
given my hat by mistake. I have yours and will
<span class="tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gladly exchange it if you will let me know when I
may call on you.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">May I not add that I am a great admirer of your
verse? Have you ever tried any musical comedy
lyrics? I think that I could get you in on the
ground floor in the show game, as I know a young
man who has written several songs which E.E.
Rice has said he would like to use in his next
comic opera—provided he can get words to go
with them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But we can discuss all this at our meeting,
which I hope will be soon, as your hat looks like
hell on me.</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">Yours respectfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">ROBERT C. BENCHLEY.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">I am quite sure that this letter was mailed, as
I find an entry in my diary of that date which
reads:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mailed a letter to J.G. Whittier. Cloudy
and cooler."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Furthermore, in a death-bed confession, some
ten years later, one Mary F. Rourke, a servant
employed in the house of Dr. Agassiz, with whom
Whittier was bunking at the time, admitted that
she herself had taken a letter, bearing my name in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the corner of the envelope, to the poet at his breakfast
on the following morning.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But whatever became of it after it fell into his
hands, I received no reply. I waited five days, during
which time I stayed in the house rather than go
out wearing the Whittier gray derby. On the sixth
day I wrote him again, as follows:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">Cambridge, Mass.<br />
Nov. 14, 1890.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Whittier:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">How about that hat of mine?</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">Yours respectfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">ROBERT C. BENCHLEY.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">I received no answer to this letter either. Concluding
that the good gray poet was either too busy
or too gosh-darned mean to bother with the thing,
I myself adopted an attitude of supercilious unconcern
and closed the correspondence with the following
terse message:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">Cambridge, Mass.<br />
December 4, 1890.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Whittier:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is my earnest wish that the hat of mine which
you are keeping will slip down over your eyes some
day, interfering with your vision to such an
<span class="tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>extent that you will walk off the sidewalk into the
gutter and receive painful, albeit superficial, injuries.</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">Your young friend,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">ROBERT C. BENCHLEY.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">Here the matter ended so far as I was concerned,
and I trust that biographers in the future will not
let any confusion of motives or misunderstanding
of dates enter into a clear and unbiased statement
of the whole affair. We must not have another
Shelley-Byron scandal.<span class="tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">II—FAMILY LIFE IN AMERICA</h1>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_6" id="toc_6"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head">PART 1</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">The naturalistic literature of this country has reached
such a state that no family of characters is considered
true to life which does not include at least two hypochondriacs,
one sadist, and one old man who spills
food down the front of his vest. If this school progresses,
the following is what we may expect in our
national literature in a year or so.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The living-room in the Twillys&#39; house was so
damp that thick, soppy moss grew all over
the walls. It dripped on the picture of Grandfather
Twilly that hung over the melodeon, making
streaks down the dirty glass like sweat on the old
man&#39;s face. It was a mean face. Grandfather
Twilly had been a mean man and had little spots
of soup on the lapel of his coat. All his children
were mean and had soup spots on their clothes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Grandma Twilly sat in the rocker over by the
window, and as she rocked the chair snapped. It
sounded like Grandma Twilly&#39;s knees snapping as
they did whenever she stooped over to pull the
wings off a fly. She was a mean old thing. Her
knuckles were grimy and she chewed crumbs that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>she found in the bottom of her reticule. You would
have hated her. She hated herself. But most of
all she hated Grandfather Twilly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I certainly hope you&#39;re frying good," she muttered
as she looked up at his picture.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hasn&#39;t the undertaker come yet, Ma?" asked
young Mrs. Wilbur Twilly petulantly. She was
boiling water on the oil-heater and every now and
again would spill a little of the steaming liquid on
the baby who was playing on the floor. She hated
the baby because it looked like her father. The
hot water raised little white blisters on the baby&#39;s
red neck and Mabel Twilly felt short, sharp twinges
of pleasure at the sight. It was the only pleasure
she had had for four months.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why don&#39;t you kill yourself, Ma?" she continued.
"You&#39;re only in the way here and you
know it. It&#39;s just because you&#39;re a mean old woman
and want to make trouble for us that you hang on."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Grandma Twilly shot a dirty look at her daughter-in-law.
She had always hated her. Stringy
hair, Mabel had. Dank, stringy hair. Grandma
Twilly thought how it would look hanging at an
Indian&#39;s belt. But all that she did was to place her
tongue against her two front teeth and make a noise
like the bath-room faucet.<span class="tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wilbur Twilly was reading the paper by the oil
lamp. Wilbur had watery blue eyes and cigar ashes
all over his knees. The third and fourth buttons of
his vest were undone. It was too hideous.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was conscious of his family seated in chairs
about him. His mother, chewing crumbs. His
wife Mabel, with her stringy hair, reading. His
sister Bernice, with projecting front teeth, who sat
thinking of the man who came every day to take
away the waste paper. Bernice was wondering
how long it would be before her family would discover
that she had been married to this man for
three years.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">How Wilbur hated them all. It didn&#39;t seem as
if he could stand it any longer. He wanted to
scream and stick pins into every one of them and
then rush out and see the girl who worked in his
office snapping rubber-bands all day. He hated her
too, but she wore side-combs.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_7" id="toc_7"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head">PART 2</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">The street was covered with slimy mud. It oozed
out from under Bernice&#39;s rubbers in unpleasant
bubbles until it seemed to her as if she must kill
herself. Hot air coming out from a steam laundry.
Hot, stifling air. Bernice didn&#39;t work in the laundry
<span class="tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>but she wished that she did so that the hot air
would kill her. She wanted to be stifled. She
needed torture to be happy. She also needed a good
swift clout on the side of the face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A drunken man lurched out from a door-way and
flung his arms about her. It was only her husband.
She loved her husband. She loved him so much
that, as she pushed him away and into the gutter,
she stuck her little finger into his eye. She also
untied his neck-tie. It was a bow neck-tie, with
white, dirty spots on it and it was wet with gin. It
didn&#39;t seem as if Bernice could stand it any longer.
All the repressions of nineteen sordid years behind
protruding teeth surged through her untidy soul.
She wanted love. But it was not her husband that
she loved so fiercely. It was old Grandfather Twilly.
And he was too dead.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_8" id="toc_8"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head">PART 3</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the dining-room of the Twillys&#39; house everything
was very quiet. Even the vinegar-cruet which
was covered with fly-specks. Grandma Twilly lay
with her head in the baked potatoes, poisoned by
Mabel, who, in her turn had been poisoned by her
husband and sprawled in an odd posture over the
china-closet. Wilbur and his sister Bernice had
<span class="tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>just finished choking each other to death and between
them completely covered the carpet in that
corner of the room where the worn spot showed the
bare boards beneath, like ribs on a chicken carcass.
Only the baby survived. She had a mean face
and had great spillings of Imperial Granum down
her bib. As she looked about her at her family, a
great hate surged through her tiny body and her
eyes snapped viciously. She wanted to get down
from her high-chair and show them all how much
she hated them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Bernice&#39;s husband, the man who came after the
waste paper, staggered into the room. The tips
were off both his shoe-lacings. The baby experienced
a voluptuous sense of futility at the sight of
the tipless-lacings and leered suggestively at her
uncle-in-law.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"We must get the roof fixed," said the man, very
quietly. "It lets the sun in."<span class="tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">III—THIS CHILD KNOWS THE ANSWER—DO YOU?</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">We are occasionally confronted in the advertisements
by the picture of an offensively
bright-looking little boy, fairly popping with information,
who, it is claimed in the text, knows all
the inside dope on why fog forms in beads on a
woolen coat, how long it would take to crawl to the
moon on your hands and knees, and what makes
oysters so quiet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The taunting catch-line of the advertisement is:
"This Child Knows the Answer—Do You?" and
the idea is to shame you into buying a set of books
containing answers to all the questions in the world
except the question "Where is the money coming
from to buy the books?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Any little boy knowing all these facts would unquestionably
be an asset in a business which specialized
in fog-beads or lunar transportation novelties,
but he would be awful to have about the house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Spencer," you might say to him, "where are
Daddy&#39;s slippers?" To which he would undoubtedly
<span class="tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>answer: "I don&#39;t know, Dad," (disagreeable
little boys like that always call their fathers "Dad"
and stand with their feet wide apart and their hands
in their pockets like girls playing boys&#39; rôles on the
stage) "but I <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">do</span> know this, that all the Nordic
peoples are predisposed to astigmatism because of
the glare of the sun on the snow, and that, furthermore,
if you were to place a common ordinary marble
in a glass of luke-warm cider there would be a
precipitation which, on pouring off the cider, would
be found to be what we know as parsley, just plain
parsley which Cook uses every night in preparing
our dinner."</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">IV—RULES AND SUGGESTIONS FOR WATCHING AUCTION BRIDGE</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">With all the expert advice that is being
offered in print these days about how to
play games, it seems odd that no one has formulated
a set of rules for the spectators. The spectators
are much more numerous than the players,
and seem to need more regulation. As a spectator
of twenty years standing, versed in watching all
sports except six-day bicycle races, I offer the fruit
of my experience in the form of suggestions and
reminiscences which may tend to clarify the situation,
or, in case there is no situation which needs
clarifying, to make one.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the event of a favorable reaction on the part
of the public, I shall form an association, to be
known as the National Amateur Audience Association
(or the N.A.A.A., if you are given to slang)
of which I shall be Treasurer. That&#39;s all I ask, the
Treasurership.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This being an off-season of the year for outdoor
sports (except walking, which is getting to have
<span class="tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>neither participants nor spectators) it seems best
to start with a few remarks on the strenuous occupation
of watching a bridge game. Bridge-watchers
are not so numerous as football watchers, for instance,
but they are much more in need of coordination
and it will be the aim of this article to formulate
a standardized set of rules for watching bridge
which may be taken as a criterion for the whole
country.</p>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_11" id="toc_11"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head">NUMBER WHO MAY WATCH</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">There should not be more than one watcher for
each table. When there are two, or more, confusion
is apt to result and no one of the watchers can devote
his attention to the game as it should be devoted.
Two watchers are also likely to bump into each
other as they make their way around the table
looking over the players&#39; shoulders. If there are
more watchers than there are tables, two can share
one table between them, one being dummy while
the other watches. In this event the first one should
watch until the hand has been dealt and six tricks
taken, being relieved by the second one for the remaining
tricks and the marking down of the score.<span class="tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_12" id="toc_12"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head">PRELIMINARIES</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">In order to avoid any charge of signalling, it will
be well for the following conversational formula to
be used before the game begins:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The ring-leader of the game says to the fifth
person: "Won&#39;t you join the game and make a
fourth? I have some work which I really ought
to be doing."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The fifth person replies: "Oh, no, thank you! I
play a wretched game. I&#39;d much rather sit here
and read, if you don&#39;t mind."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To which the ring-leader replies: "Pray do."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After the first hand has been dealt, the fifth
person, whom we shall now call the "watcher," puts
down the book and leans forward in his (or her)
chair, craning the neck to see what is in the hand
nearest him. The strain becoming too great, he
arises and approaches the table, saying: "Do you
mind if I watch a bit?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">No answer need be given to this, unless someone
at the table has nerve enough to tell the truth.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_13" id="toc_13"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head">PROCEDURE</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">The game is now on. The watcher walks around
the table, giving each hand a careful scrutiny, groaning
slightly at the sight of a poor one and making
<span class="tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>noises of joyful anticipation at the good ones. Stopping
behind an especially unpromising array of cards,
it is well to say: "Well, unlucky at cards, lucky
in love, you know." This gives the partner an
opportunity to judge his chances on the bid he is
about to make, and is perfectly fair to the other
side, too, for they are not left entirely in the dark.
Thus everyone benefits by the remark.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image02" id="image02" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image02.png" alt="The watcher walks around the table, giving each hand a careful scrutiny." class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">The watcher walks around the table, giving each hand a
careful scrutiny.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When the bidding begins, the watcher has considerable
opportunity for effective work. Having
seen how the cards lie, he is able to stand back
and listen with a knowing expression, laughing
at unjustified bids and urging on those who
should, in his estimation, plunge. At the conclusion
of the bidding he should say: "Well,
we&#39;re off!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As the hand progresses and the players become
intent on the game, the watcher may be the cause
of no little innocent diversion. He may ask one of
the players for a match, or, standing behind the one
who is playing the hand, he may say:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ll give you three guesses as to whom I ran into
on the street yesterday. Someone you all know.
Used to go to school with you, Harry ... Light
hair and blue eyes ... Medium build ... Well,
sir, it was Lew Milliken. Yessir, Lew Milliken.
Hadn&#39;t seen him for fifteen years. Asked after you,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Harry ... and George too. And what do you
think he told me about Chick?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Answers may or may not be returned to these
remarks, according to the good nature of the players,
but in any event, they serve their purpose of distraction.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Particular care should be taken that no one of
the players is allowed to make a mistake. The
watcher, having his mind free, is naturally in a
better position to keep track of matters of sequence
and revoking. Thus, he may say:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The lead was over here, George," or</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think that you refused spades a few hands
ago, Lillian."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Of course, there are some watchers who have an
inherited delicacy about offering advice or talking
to the players. Some people are that way. They
are interested in the game, and love to watch but
they feel that they ought not to interfere. I had
a cousin who just wouldn&#39;t talk while a hand was
being played, and so, as she had to do something,
she hummed. She didn&#39;t hum very well, and her
program was limited to the first two lines of "How
Firm a Foundation," but she carried it off very well
and often got the players to humming it along with
her. She could also drum rather well with her
fingers on the back of the chair of one of the players
<span class="tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>while looking over his shoulder. "How Firm a
Foundation" didn&#39;t lend itself very well to drumming;
so she had a little patrol that she worked up
all by herself, beginning soft, like a drum corps in
the distance, and getting louder and louder, finally
dying away again so that you could barely near it.
It was wonderful how she could do it—and still
go on living.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Those who feel this way about talking while others
are playing bridge have a great advantage over my
cousin and her class if they can play the piano.
They play ever so softly, in order not to disturb,
but somehow or other you just know that they are
there, and that the next to last note in the coda is
going to be very sour.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But, of course, the piano work does not technically
come under the head of watching, although when
there are two watchers to a table, one may go over
to the piano while she is dummy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But your real watcher will allow nothing to interfere
with his conscientious following of the game,
and it is for real watchers only that these suggestions
have been formulated. The minute you get
out of the class of those who have the best interests
of the game at heart, you become involved in dilettantism
and amateurishness, and the whole sport of
bridge-watching falls into disrepute.<span class="tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The only trouble with the game as it now stands
is the risk of personal injury. This can be eliminated
by the watcher insisting on each player being
frisked for weapons before the game begins and
cultivating a good serviceable defense against ordinary
forms of fistic attack.<span class="tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">V—A CHRISTMAS SPECTACLE</h1>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">For Use in Christmas Eve Entertainments in the
Vestry</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">At the opening of the entertainment the Superintendent
will step into the footlights, recover
his balance apologetically, and say:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Boys and girls of the Intermediate Department,
parents and friends: I suppose you all know why
we are here tonight. (At this point the audience
will titter apprehensively). Mrs. Drury and her
class of little girls have been working very hard
to make this entertainment a success, and I am sure
that everyone here to-night is going to have what
I overheard one of my boys the other day calling
&#39;some good time.&#39; (Indulgent laughter from the
little boys). And may I add before the curtain goes
up that immediately after the entertainment we
want you all to file out into the Christian Endeavor
room, where there will be a Christmas tree,
&#39;with all the fixin&#39;s,&#39; as the boys say." (Shrill
whistling from the little boys and immoderate applause
from everyone).<span class="tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There will then be a wait of twenty-five minutes,
while sounds of hammering and dropping may be
heard from behind the curtains. The Boys&#39; Club
orchestra will render the "Poet and Peasant Overture"
four times in succession, each time differently.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At last one side of the curtains will be drawn
back; the other will catch on something and have
to be released by hand; someone will whisper
loudly, "Put out the lights," following which the
entire house will be plunged into darkness. Amid
catcalls from the little boys, the footlights will at
last go on, disclosing:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The windows in the rear of the vestry rather
ineffectively concealed by a group of small fir trees
on standards, one of which has already fallen over,
leaving exposed a corner of the map of Palestine
and the list of gold-star classes for November. In
the center of the stage is a larger tree, undecorated,
while at the extreme left, invisible to everyone in
the audience except those sitting at the extreme
right, is an imitation fireplace, leaning against the
wall.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Twenty-five seconds too early little Flora Rochester
will prance out from the wings, uttering the first
shrill notes of a song, and will have to be grabbed
by eager hands and pulled back. Twenty-four
seconds later the piano will begin "The Return of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Reindeer" with a powerful accent on the first
note of each bar, and Flora Rochester, Lillian McNulty,
Gertrude Hamingham and Martha Wrist will
swirl on, dressed in white, and advance heavily into
the footlights, which will go out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There will then be an interlude while Mr. Neff,
the sexton, adjusts the connection, during which
the four little girls stand undecided whether to
brave it out or cry. As a compromise they giggle
and are herded back into the wings by Mrs. Drury,
amid applause. When the lights go on again, the
applause becomes deafening, and as Mr. Neff walks
triumphantly away, the little boys in the audience
will whistle: "There she goes, there she goes, all
dressed up in her Sunday clothes!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The Return of the Reindeer" will be started
again and the show-girls will reappear, this time
more gingerly and somewhat dispirited. They will,
however, sing the following, to the music of the
"Ballet Pizzicato" from "Sylvia":</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p class="tei tei-l">"We greet you, we greet you,</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">On this Christmas Eve so fine.</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">We greet you, we greet you,</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">And wish you a good time."</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">They will then turn toward the tree and Flora
Rochester will advance, hanging a silver star on one
<span class="tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the branches, meanwhile reciting a verse, the
only distinguishable words of which are: "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">I am
Faith so strong and pure</span>—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At the conclusion of her recitation, the star will
fall off.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Lillian McNulty will then step forward and hang
her star on a branch, reading her lines in clear
tones:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">"And I am Hope, a virtue great,</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">My gift to Christmas now I make,</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">That children and grown-ups may hope today</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">That tomorrow will be a merry Christmas Day."</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">The hanging of the third star will be consummated
by Gertrude Hamingham, who will get as far
as "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Sweet Charity I bring to place upon the
tree</span>—" at which point the strain will become too
great and she will forget the remainder. After
several frantic glances toward the wings, from
which Mrs. Drury is sending out whispered messages
to the effect that the next line begins, "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">My
message bright</span>—" Gertrude will disappear, crying
softly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image03" id="image03" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image03.png" alt="&quot;&#39;Round and &#39;round the tree I go.&quot;" class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Round and &#39;round the tree I go."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After the morale of the cast has been in some
measure restored by the pianist, who, with great
presence of mind, plays a few bars of "Will There
Be Any Stars In My Crown?" to cover up Gertrude&#39;s
<span class="tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>exit, Martha Wrist will unleash a rope of
silver tinsel from the foot of the tree, and, stringing
it over the boughs as she skips around in a circle,
will say, with great assurance:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">"&#39;Round and &#39;round the tree I go,</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Through the holly and the snow</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Bringing love and Christmas cheer</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Through the happy year to come."</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">At this point there will be a great commotion
and jangling of sleigh-bells off-stage, and Mr.
Creamer, rather poorly disguised as Santa Claus,
will emerge from the opening in the imitation fire-place.
A great popular demonstration for Mr.
Creamer will follow. He will then advance to the
footlights, and, rubbing his pillow and ducking his
knees to denote joviality, will say thickly through
his false beard:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, well, well, what have we here? A lot
of bad little boys and girls who aren&#39;t going to
get any Christmas presents this year? (Nervous
laughter from the little boys and girls). Let me
see, let me see! I have a note here from Dr. Whidden.
Let&#39;s see what it says. (Reads from a paper
on which there is obviously nothing written). &#39;If
you and the young people of the Intermediate Department
will come into the Christian Endeavor
<span class="tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>room, I think we may have a little surprise for you ...&#39;
Well, well, well! What do you suppose it
can be? (Cries of "I know, I know!" from sophisticated
ones in the audience). Maybe it is a
bottle of castor-oil! (Raucous jeers from the little
boys and elaborately simulated disgust on the part
of the little girls.) Well, anyway, suppose we go
out and see? Now if Miss Liftnagle will oblige us
with a little march on the piano, we will all form
in single file—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At this point there will ensue a stampede toward
the Christian Endeavor room, in which chairs will
be broken, decorations demolished, and the protesting
Mr. Creamer badly hurt.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This will bring to a close the first part of the
entertainment.<span class="tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">VI—HOW TO WATCH A CHESS-MATCH</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Second in the list of games which it is necessary
for every sportsman to know how to watch
comes chess. If you don&#39;t know how to watch
chess, the chances are that you will never have any
connection with the game whatsoever. You would
not, by any chance, be playing it yourself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I know some very nice people that play chess,
mind you, and I wouldn&#39;t have thought that I was
in any way spoofing at the game. I would sooner
spoof at the people who engineered the Panama
Canal or who are drawing up plans for the vehicular
tunnel under the Hudson River. I am no man to
make light of chess and its adherents, although they
might very well make light of me. In fact, they
have.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But what I say is, that taking society by and
large, man and boy, the chances are that chess
would be the Farmer-Labor Party among the contestants
for sporting honors.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now, since it is settled that you probably will
not want to play chess, unless you should be laid
<span class="tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>up with a bad knee-pan or something, it follows that,
if you want to know anything about the sport at all,
you will have to watch it from the side-lines. That
is what this series of lessons aims to teach you to
do, (of course, if you are going to be nasty and
say that you don&#39;t want even to watch it, why all
this time has been, wasted on my part as well as
on yours).</p>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_16" id="toc_16"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head">HOW TO FIND A GAME TO WATCH</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first problem confronting the chess spectator
is to find some people who are playing. The
bigger the city, the harder it is to find anyone
indulging in chess. In a small town you can usually
go straight to Wilbur Tatnuck&#39;s General Store, and
be fairly sure of finding a quiet game in progress
over behind the stove and the crate of pilot-biscuit,
but as you draw away from the mitten district you
find the sporting instinct of the population cropping
out in other lines and chess becoming more and more
restricted to the sheltered corners of Y.M.C.A.
club-rooms and exclusive social organizations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">However, we shall have to suppose, in order to
get any article written at all, that you have found
two people playing chess somewhere. They probably
will neither see nor hear you as you come up
<span class="tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on them so you can stand directly behind the one
who is defending the south goal without fear of
detection.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_17" id="toc_17"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head">THE DETAILS OF THE GAME</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">At first you may think that they are both dead,
but a mirror held to the lips of the nearest contestant
will probably show moisture (unless, of course,
they really should be dead, which would be a horrible
ending for a little lark like this. I once
heard of a murderer who propped his two victims
up against a chess board in sporting attitudes and
was able to get as far as Seattle before his crime
was discovered).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Soon you will observe a slight twitching of an
eye-lid or a moistening of the lips and then, like
a greatly retarded moving-picture of a person passing
the salt, one of the players will lift a chess-man
from one spot on the board and place it on another
spot.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It would be best not to stand too close to the
board at this time as you are are likely to be trampled
on in the excitement. For this action that
you have just witnessed corresponds to a run around
right end in a football game or a two-bagger in
baseball, and is likely to cause considerable enthusiasm
<span class="tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on the one hand and deep depression on the
other. They may even forget themselves to the
point of shifting their feet or changing the hands
on which they are resting their foreheads. Almost
anything is liable to happen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When the commotion has died down a little, it
will be safe for you to walk around and stand behind
the other player and wait there for the next
move. While waiting it would be best to stand
with the weight of your body evenly distributed
between your two feet, for you will probably be
standing there a long time and if you bear down
on one foot all of the time, that foot is bound to
get tired. A comfortable stance for watching chess
is with the feet slightly apart (perhaps a foot or a
foot and a half), with a slight bend at the knees
to rest the legs and the weight of the body thrown
forward on the balls of the feet. A rhythmic rising
on the toes, holding the hands behind the back, the
head well up and the chest out, introduces a note
of variety into the position which will be welcome
along about dusk.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Not knowing anything about the game, you will
perhaps find it difficult at first to keep your attention
on the board. This can be accomplished by
means of several little optical tricks. For instance,
if you look at the black and white squares on the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>board very hard and for a very long time, they will
appear to jump about and change places. The
black squares will rise from the board about a
quarter of an inch and slightly overlap the white
ones. Then, if you change focus suddenly, the
white squares will do the same thing to the black
ones. And finally, after doing this until someone
asks you what you are looking cross-eyed for, if
you will shut your eyes tight you will see an exact
reproduction of the chess-board, done in pink and
green, in your mind&#39;s eye. By this time, the players
will be almost ready for another move.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This will make two moves that you have watched.
It is now time to get a little fancy work into your
game. About an hour will have already gone by
and you should be so thoroughly grounded in the
fundamentals of chess watching that you can proceed
to the next step.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Have some one of your friends bring you a chair,
a table and an old pyrography outfit, together with
some book-ends on which to burn a design.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Seat yourself at the table in the chair and (if I
remember the process correctly) squeeze the bulb
attached to the needle until the latter becomes red
hot. Then, grasping the book-ends in the left hand,
carefully trace around the pencilled design with
the point of the needle. It probably will be a picture
<span class="tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the Lion of Lucerne, and you will let the
needle slip on the way round the face, giving it the
appearance of having shaved in a Pullman that
morning. But that really won&#39;t make any difference,
for the whole thing is not so much to do a
nice pair of book-ends as to help you along in
watching the chess-match.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If you have any scruples against burning wood,
you may knit something, or paste stamps in an
album.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And before you know it, the game will be over
and you can put on your things and go home.<span class="tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_18" id="toc_18"></a>
<h1 class="tei tei-head">VII—WATCHING BASEBALL</h1>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">D.A.C. NEWS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Eighteen men play a game of baseball and
eighteen thousand watch them, and yet those
who play are the only ones who have any
official direction in the matter of rules and regulations.
The eighteen thousand are allowed to run
wild. They don&#39;t have even a Spalding&#39;s Guide containing
group photographs of model organizations
of fans in Fall River, Mass., or the Junior Rooters
of Lyons, Nebraska. Whatever course of behavior
a fan follows at a game he makes up for
himself. This is, of course, ridiculous.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first set of official rulings for spectators at
baseball games has been formulated and is herewith
reproduced. It is to be hoped that in the
general cleanup which the game is undergoing,
the grandstand and bleachers will not resent a little
dictation from the authorities.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the first place, there is the question of shouting
encouragement, or otherwise, at the players. There
<span class="tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>must be no more random screaming. It is of course
understood that the players are entirely dependent
on the advice offered them from the stands for their
actions in the game, and how is a batter to know
what to do if, for instance, he hears a little man in
the bleachers shouting, "Wait for &#39;em, Wally!
Wait for &#39;em," and another little man in the south
stand shouting "Take a crack at the first one,
Wally!"? What would you do? What would
Lincoln have done?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The official advisers in the stands must work
together. They must remember that as the batter
advances toward the plate he is listening for them
to give him his instructions, and if he hears conflicting
advice there is no telling what he may do.
He may even have to decide for himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Therefore, before each player goes to bat, there
should be a conference among the fans who have
ideas on what his course of action should be, and
as soon as a majority have come to a decision, the
advice should be shouted to the player in unison
under the direction of a cheer-leader. If there are
any dissenting opinions, they may be expressed in
a minority report.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the matter of hostile remarks addressed at an
unpopular player on the visiting team, it would
probably be better to leave the wording entirely
<span class="tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the individual fans. Each man has his own
talents in this sort of thing and should be allowed
to develop them along natural lines. In such crises
as these in which it becomes necessary to rattle
the opposing pitcher or prevent the visiting catcher
from getting a difficult foul, all considerations of
good sportsmanship should be discarded. As a
matter of fact, it is doubtful if good sportsmanship
should ever be allowed to interfere with the fan&#39;s
participation in a contest. The game must be kept
free from all softening influences.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">One of the chief duties of the fan is to engage
in arguments with the man behind him. This
department of the game has been allowed to run
down fearfully. A great many men go to a ball
game today and never speak a word to anyone
other than the members of their own party or an
occasional word of cheer to a player. This is
nothing short of craven.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">An ardent supporter of the home-team should
go to a game prepared to take offense, no matter
what happens. He should be equipped with a stock
of ready sallies which can be used regardless of
what the argument is about or what has gone
before in the exchange of words. Among the more
popular nuggets of repartee, effective on all occasions,
are the following:<span class="tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, is that so?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Eah?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How do you get that way?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, is that so?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"So are you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Aw, go have your hair bobbed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, is that so?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Who says so?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Eah? Well, I&#39;ll Cincinnati you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, is that so?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Any one of these, if hurled with sufficient venom,
is good for ten points. And it should always be
borne in mind that there is no danger of physical
harm resulting from even the most ferocious-sounding
argument. Statistics gathered by the War
Department show that the percentage of actual
blows struck in grandstand arguments is one in
every 43,000,000.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For those fans who are occasionally obliged to
take inexperienced lady-friends to a game, a special
set of rules has been drawn up. These include the
compulsory purchase of tickets in what is called
the "Explaining Section," a block of seats set aside
by the management for the purpose. The view of
the diamond from this section is not very good, but
it doesn&#39;t matter, as the men wouldn&#39;t see anything
<span class="tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the game anyway and the women can see just
enough to give them material for questions and
to whet their curiosity. As everyone around you is
answering questions and trying to explain score-keeping,
there is not the embarrassment which is
usually attendant on being overheard by unattached
fans in the vicinity. There is also not the distracting
sound of breaking pencils and modified cursing
to interfere with unattached fans&#39; enjoyment of the
game.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Absolutely no gentlemen with uninformed ladies
will be admitted to the main stand. In order to
enforce this regulation, a short examination on the
rudiments of the game will take place at the gate,
in which ladies will be expected to answer briefly the
following questions: (Women examiners will be in
attendance.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">1. What game is it that is being played on this
field?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">2. How many games have you seen before?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">3. What is (a) a pitcher; (b) a base; (c) a bat?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">4. What color uniform does the home-team wear?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">5. What is the name of the home-team?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">6. In the following sentence, cross out the incorrect

<p class="tei tei-p">It has been decided that the American baseball

national pastime.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Straw hat, worn well back on the head; one cigar,

<h1 class="tei tei-head">VIII—HOW TO BE A SPECTATOR AT SPRING PLANTING</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The danger in watching gardening, as in watching
many other sports, is that you may be
drawn into it yourself. This you must fight against.
Your sinecure standing depends on a rigid abstinence
from any of the work itself. Once you stoop
over to hold one end of a string for a groaning
planter, once you lift one shovelful of earth or toss
out one stone, you become a worker and a worker
is an abomination in the eyes of the true garden
watcher.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A fence is, therefore, a great help. You may take
up your position on the other side of the fence from
the garden and lean heavily against it smoking a
pipe, or you may even sit on it. Anything so long as
you are out of helping distance and yet near enough
so that the worker will be within easy range of
your voice. You ought to be able to point a great
deal, also.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is much to be watched during the early
stages of garden-preparation. Nothing is so satisfying
<span class="tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as to lean ruminatingly against a fence and
observe the slow, rhythmic swing of the digger&#39;s
back or hear the repeated scraping of the shovel-edge
against some buried rock. It sometimes is a
help to the digger to sing a chanty, just to give him
the beat. And then sometimes it is not. He will
tell you in case he doesn&#39;t need it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is always a great deal for the watcher to
do in the nature of comment on the soil. This is
especially true if it is a new garden or has never been
cultivated before by the present owner. The idea
is to keep the owner from becoming too sanguine
over the prospects.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That soil looks pretty clayey," is a good thing
to say. (It is hard to say, clearly, too. You had
better practise it before trying it out on the
gardener).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t think that you&#39;ll have much luck with
potatoes in that kind of earth," is another helpful
approach. It is even better to go at it the other way,
finding out first what the owner expects to plant.
It may be that he isn&#39;t going to plant any potatoes,
and then there you are, stuck with a perfectly dandy
prediction which has no bearing on the case. It is
time enough to pull it after he has told you that
he expects to plant peas, beans, beets, corn. Then
you can interrupt him and say: "Corn?" incredulously.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>"You don&#39;t expect to get any corn in that
soil do you? Don&#39;t you know that corn requires
a large percentage of bi-carbonate of soda in the soil,
and I don&#39;t think, from the looks, that there is an
ounce of soda bi-carb. in your whole plot. Even
if the corn does come up, it will be so tough you can&#39;t
eat it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then you can laugh, and call out to a neighbor,
or even to the man&#39;s wife: "Hey, what do you
know? Steve here thinks he&#39;s going to get some
corn up in this soil!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The watcher will find plenty to do when the time
comes to pick the stones out of the freshly turned-over
earth. It is his work to get upon a high place
where he can survey the whole garden and detect
the more obvious rocks.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Here is a big fella over here, Steve," he may say.
Or: "Just run your rake a little over in that corner.
I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll find a nest of them there."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Plymouth Rock" is a funny thing to call any
particularly offensive boulder, and is sure to get
a laugh, especially if you kid the digger good-naturedly
about being a Pilgrim and landing on it.
He may even give it to you to keep.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Just as a matter of convenience for the worker,
watchers have sometimes gone to the trouble of
keeping count of the number of stones thrown out.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>This is done by shouting out the count after each
stone has been tossed. It makes a sort of game of
the thing, and in this spirit the digger may be urged
on to make a record.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s forty-eight, old man! Come on now,
make her fifty. Attaboy, forty-nine! Only one
more to go. We-want-fifty-we-want-fifty-we-want
fifty."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And not only stones will be found, but queer
objects which have got themselves buried in the
ground during the winter-months and have become
metamorphosed, so they are half way between one
thing and another. As the digger holds one of
these <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">objets dirt</span> gingerly between his thumb and
forefinger the watcher has plenty of opportunity to
shout out:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You&#39;d better save that. It may come in handy
some day. What is it, Eddie? Your old beard?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And funny cracks like that.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Here is where it is going to be difficult to keep
to your resolution about not helping. After the
digging, and stoning, and turning-over has been
done, and the ground is all nice and soft and loamy,
the idea of running a rake softly over the susceptible
surface and leaving a beautiful even design in its
wake, is almost too tempting to be withstood.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image04" id="image04" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image04.png" alt="&quot;Atta boy, forty-nine: Only one more to go!&quot;" class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">"Atta boy, forty-nine: Only one more to go!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The worker himself will do all that he can to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>make it hard for you. He will rake with evident
delight, much longer than is necessary, back and
forth, across and back, cocking his head and surveying
the pattern and fixing it up along the edges
with a care which is nothing short of insulting considering
the fact that the whole thing has got to be
mussed up again when the planting begins.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If you feel that you can no longer stand it without
offering to assist, get down from the fence and go
into your own house and up to your own room.
There pray for strength. By the time you come
down, the owner of the garden ought to have stopped
raking and got started on the planting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Here the watcher&#39;s task is almost entirely advisory.
And, for the first part of the planting, he
should lie low and say nothing. Wait until the
planter has got his rows marked out and has wobbled
along on his knees pressing the seeds into perhaps
half the length of his first row. Then say:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hey there, Charlie! You&#39;ve got those rows
going the wrong way."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Charlie will say no he hasn&#39;t. Then he will ask
what you mean the wrong way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, you poor cod, you&#39;ve got them running
north and south. They ought to go east and west.
The sun rises over there, doesn&#39;t it?" (Charlie
will attempt to deny this, but you must go right on.)
<span class="tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>"And it comes on up behind that tree and over my
roof and sets over there, doesn&#39;t it?" (By this
time, Charlie will be crying with rage.) "Well,
just as soon as your beans get up an inch or two
they are going to cast a shadow right down the
whole row and only those in front will ever get any
sun. You can&#39;t grow things without sun, you
know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If Charlie takes you seriously and starts in to
rearrange his rows in the other direction, you might
perhaps get down off the fence and go in the house.
You have done enough. If he doesn&#39;t take you
seriously, you surely had better go in.<span class="tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">IX—THE MANHATTADOR</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Announcements have been made of a
bull-fight to be held in Madison Square
Garden, New York, in which only the more humane
features of the Spanish institution are to be retained.
The bull will not be killed, or even hurt,
and horses will not be used as bait.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If a bull-fight must be held, this is of course the
way to hold it, but what features are to be substituted
for the playful gorings and stabbings of
the Madrid system? Something must be done to
enrage the bull, otherwise he will just sulk in a
corner or walk out on the whole affair. Following
is a suggestion for the program of events:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">1. Grand parade around the ring, headed by a
brass-band and the mayor in matador&#39;s costume.
Invitations to march in this parade will be issued
to every one in the bull-fighting set with the exception
of the bull, who will be ignored. This will
make him pretty sore to start with.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">2. After the marchers have been seated, the bull
will be led into the ring. An organized cheering
<span class="tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>section among the spectators will immediately start
jeering him, whistling, and calling "Take off those
horns, we know you!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">3. The picadors will now enter, bearing pikes
with ticklers on the ends. These will be brushed
across the bull&#39;s nose as the picadors rush past
him on noisy motor-cycles. The noise of the motor-cycles
is counted on to irritate the bull quite as much
as the ticklers, as he will probably be trying to
sleep at the time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">4. Enter the bandilleros, carrying various ornate
articles of girls&#39; clothing (daisy-hat with blue ribbons,
pink sash, lace jabot, etc.) which will, one by
one, be hung on the bull when he isn&#39;t looking. In
order to accomplish this, one of the bandilleros will
engage the animal in conversation while another
sneaks up behind him with the frippery. When he
is quite trimmed, the bandilleros will withdraw to
behind a shelter and call him: "Lizzie!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">5. By this time, the bull will be almost crying
he will be so sore. This is the moment for the entrance
of the intrepid matador. The matador will
wear an outing cap with a cutaway and Jaeger
vest, and the animal will become so infuriated by
this inexcusable <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">mésalliance</span> of garments that he will
charge madly at his antagonist. The matador, who
will be equipped with boxing-gloves, will feint with
<span class="tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his left and pull the daisy-hat down over the bull&#39;s
eyes with his right, immediately afterward stepping
quickly to one side. The bull, blinded by the
daisies, will not know where to go next and soon will
laughingly admit that the joke has been on him.
He will then allow the matador to jump on his back
and ride around the ring, making good-natured attempts
to unseat his rider.<span class="tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">X—WHAT TO DO WHILE THE FAMILY IS AWAY</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Somewhere or other the legend has sprung
up that, as soon as the family goes away for
the summer, Daddy brushes the hair over his bald
spot, ties up his shoes, and goes out on a whirlwind
trip through the hellish districts of town. The
funny papers are responsible for this, just as they
are responsible for the idea that all millionaires
are fat and that Negroes are inordinately fond of
watermelons.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I will not deny that for just about four minutes
after the train has left, bearing Mother, Sister,
Junior, Ingabog and the mechanical walrus on their
way to Anybunkport, Daddy is suffused with a
certain queer feeling of being eleven years old and
down-town alone for the first time with fifteen cents
to spend on anything he wants. The city seems to
spread itself out before him just ablaze with lights
and his feet rise lightly from the ground as if attached
to toy balloons. I do not deny that his first
move is to straighten his tie.<span class="tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But five minutes would be a generous allowance
for the duration of this foot-loose elation. As he
leaves the station he suddenly becomes aware of the
fact that no one else has heard about his being
fancy-free. Everyone seems to be going somewhere
in a very important manner. A great many
people, oddly enough seem to be going home.
Ordinarily he would be going home, too. But
there would not be much sense in going home now,
without—. But come, come, this is no way to
feel! Buck up, man! How about a wild oat or
two?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Around at the club the doorman says that Mr.
McNartly hasn&#39;t been in all afternoon and that
Mr. Freem was in at about four-thirty but went out
again with a bag. There is no one in the lounge
whom he ever saw before. A lot of new members
must have been taken in at the last meeting. The
club is running down fast. He calls up Eddie Mastayer&#39;s
office but he has gone for the day. Oh,
well, someone will probably come in for dinner.
He hasn&#39;t eaten dinner at the club for a long time
and there will be just time for a swim before settling
down to a nice piece of salmon steak.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">All the new members seem to be congregated now
in the pool and they look him over as if he were a
fresh-air child being given a day&#39;s outing. He becomes
<span class="tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>self-conscious and slips on the marble floor,
falling and hurting his shin quite badly. Who the
hell are these people anyway? And where is the
old bunch? He emerges from the locker room
much hotter than he was before and in addition,
boiling with rage.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dinner is one of the most depressing rituals he
has ever gone through with. Even the waiters seem
unfamiliar. Once he even gets up and goes out
to the front of the building to see if he hasn&#39;t got
into the wrong club-house by mistake. Pretty soon
a terrible person whose name is either Riegle
or Ropple comes and sits down with him, offering
as his share of the conversation the dogmatic announcement
that it has been hotter today than it
was yesterday. This is denied with some feeling,
although it is known to be true. Dessert is dispensed
with for the sake of getting away from
Riegle or Ropple or whatever his name is.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then the first gay evening looms up ahead.
What to do? There is nothing to prevent his
drawing all the money out of the bank and tearing
the town wide open from the City Hall to the Soldier&#39;s
Monument. There is nothing to prevent his
formally introducing himself to some nice blonde
and watching her get the meat out of a lobster-claw.
There is nothing to prevent his hiring some bootlegger
<span class="tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to anoint him with synthetic gin until he
glows like a fire-fly and imagines that he has just
been elected Mayor on a Free Ice-Cream ticket.
Absolutely nothing stands in his way, except a dispairing
vision of crêpe letters before his eyes reading:"—And For What?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He ends up by going to the movies where he falls
asleep. Rather than go home to the empty house
he stays at the club. In the morning he is at the
office at a quarter to seven.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now there ought to be several things that a man
could do at home to relieve the tedium of his existence
while the family is away. Once you get
accustomed to the sound of your footsteps on the
floors and reach a state of self-control where you
don&#39;t break down and sob every time you run into
a toy which has been left standing around, there are
lots of ways of keeping yourself amused in an
empty house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">You can set the victrola going and dance. You
may never have had an opportunity to get off by
yourself and practice those new steps without someone&#39;s
coming suddenly into the room and making
you look foolish. (That&#39;s one big advantage about
being absolutely alone in a house. You can&#39;t <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">look</span>
foolish, no matter what you do. You may <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">be</span>
foolish, but no one except you and your God knows
<span class="tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>about it and God probably has a great deal too
much to do to go around telling people how foolish
you were). So roll back the rugs and put on
"Kalua" and, holding out one arm in as fancy a
manner as you wish, slip the other daintily about
the waist of an imaginary partner and step out.
You&#39;d be surprised to see how graceful you are.
Pretty soon you will get confidence to try a few
tricks. A very nice one is to stop in the middle
of a step, point the left toe delicately twice in time
to the music, dip, and whirl. It makes no difference
if you fall on the whirl. Who cares? And when
you are through dancing you can go out to the
faucet and get yourself a drink—provided the
water hasn&#39;t been turned off.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Lots of fun may also be had by going out into the
kitchen and making things with whatever is left
in the pantry. There will probably be plenty of
salt and nutmegs, with boxes of cooking soda,
tapioca, corn-starch and maybe, if you are lucky,
an old bottle of olives. Get out a cook-book and
choose something that looks nice in the picture. In
place of the ingredients which you do not have,
substitute those which you do, thus: nutmegs for
eggs, tapioca for truffles, corn-starch and water for
milk, and so forth and so forth. Then go in and
set the table according to the instructions in the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cook-book for a Washington&#39;s Birthday party, light
the candles, and with one of them set fire to the
house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is probably a night-train for Anybunkport
which you can catch while the place is still burning.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Inside Points on Building and Maintaining a
Private Tennis Court</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now that the Great War is practically over,
until the next one begins there isn&#39;t very
much that you can do with that large plot of
ground which used to be your war-garden. It is
too small for a running-track and too large for
nasturtiums. Obviously, the only thing left is a
tennis-court.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">One really ought to have a tennis-court of one&#39;s
own. Those at the Club are always so full that on
Saturdays and Sundays the people waiting to play
look like the gallery at a Davis Cup match, and
even when you do get located you have two sets of
balls to chase, yours and those of the people in the
next court.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first thing is to decide among yourselves just
what kind of court it is to be. There are three
kinds: grass, clay, and corn-meal. In Maine,
gravel courts are also very popular. Father will
usually hold out for a grass court because it gives
<span class="tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a slower bounce to the ball and Father isn&#39;t so quick
on the bounce as he used to be. All Mother insists
on is plenty of headroom. Junior and Myrtis will
want a clay one because you can dance on a clay
one in the evening. The court as finished will be
a combination grass and dirt, with a little golden-rod
late in August.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A little study will be necessary before laying out
the court. I mean you can&#39;t just go out and mark
a court by guess-work. You must first learn what
the dimensions are supposed to be and get as near
to them as is humanly possible. Whereas there
might be a slight margin for error in some measurements,
it is absolutely essential that both sides are
the same length, otherwise you might end up by
lobbing back to yourself if you got very excited.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The worst place to get the dope on how to
arrange a tennis-court is in the Encyclopædia Britannica.
The article on TENNIS was evidently
written by the Archbishop of Canterbury. It begins
by explaining that in America tennis is called
"court tennis." The only answer to that is,
"You&#39;re a cock-eyed liar!" The whole article is
like this.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The name "tennis," it says, probably comes from
the French "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Tenez</span>!" meaning "Take it! Play!"
More likely, in my opinion, it is derived from the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Polish "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Tinith</span>!" meaning "Go on, that was <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">not</span>
outside!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">During the Fourteenth Century the game was
played by the highest people in France. Louis X
died from a chill contracted after playing. Charles
V was devoted to it, although he tried in vain to
stop it as a pastime for the lower classes (the
origin of the country-club); Charles VI watched it
being played from the room where he was confined
during his attack of insanity and Du Guesclin
amused himself with it during the siege of Dinan.
And, although it doesn&#39;t say so in the Encyclopædia,
Robert C. Benchley, after playing for the first time
in the season of 1922, was so lame under the right
shoulder-blade that he couldn&#39;t lift a glass to his
mouth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This fascinating historical survey of tennis goes
on to say that in the reign of Henri IV the game
was so popular that it was said that "there were
more tennis-players in Paris than drunkards in
England." The drunkards of England were so
upset by this boast that they immediately started
a drive for membership with the slogan, "Five
thousand more drunkards by April 15, and to Hell
with France!" One thing led to another until war
was declared.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The net does not appear until the 17th century.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Up until that time a rope, either fringed or tasseled,
was stretched across the court. This probably had
to be abandoned because it was so easy to crawl
under it and chase your opponent. There might
also have been ample opportunity for the person
playing at the net or at the "rope," to catch the eye
of the player directly opposite by waving his racquet
high in the air and then to kick him under the
rope, knocking him for a loop while the ball was
being put into play in his territory. You have to
watch these Frenchmen every minute.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Encyclopedia Britannica gives fifteen lines
to "Tennis in America." It says that "few tennis
courts existed in America before 1880, but that now
there are courts in Boston, New York, Chicago,
Tuxedo and Lakewood and several other places."
Everyone try hard to think now just where those
other places are!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Which reminds us that one of them is going to
be in your side yard where the garden used to be.
After you have got the dimensions from the Encyclopædia,
call up a professional tennis-court maker
and get him to do the job for you. Just tell him
that you want "a tennis-court."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Once it is built the fun begins. According to the
arrangement, each member of the family is to have
certain hours during which it belongs to them and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>no one else. Thus the children can play before
breakfast and after breakfast until the sun gets
around so that the west court is shady. Then
Daddy and Mother and sprightly friends may take
it over. Later in the afternoon the children have it
again, and if there is any light left after dinner
Daddy can take a whirl at the ball.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What actually will happen is this: Right after
breakfast Roger Beeman, who lives across the street
and who is home for the summer with a couple of
college friends who are just dandy looking, will
come over and ask if they may use the court until
someone wants it. They will let Myrtis play with
them and perhaps Myrtis&#39; girl-chum from Westover.
They will play five sets, running into scores
like 19-17, and at lunch time will make plans for a
ride into the country for the afternoon. Daddy will
stick around in the offing all dressed up in his
tennis-clothes waiting to play with Uncle Ted, but
somehow or other every time he approaches the
court the young people will be in the middle of a set.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image05" id="image05" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image05.png" alt="For three hours there is a great deal of screaming." class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">For three hours there is a great deal of screaming.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After lunch, Lillian Nieman, who lives three
houses down the street, will come up and ask if she
may bring her cousin (just on from the West) to
play a set until someone wants the court. Lillian&#39;s
cousin has never played tennis before but she has
done a lot of croquet and thinks she ought to pick
<span class="tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tennis up rather easily. For three hours there is a
great deal of screaming, with Lillian and her cousin
hitting the ball an aggregate of eleven times, while
Daddy patters up and down the side-lines, all
dressed up in white, practising shots against the
netting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Finally, the girls will ask him to play with them,
and he will thank them and say that he has to go
in the house now as he is all perspiration and is
afraid of catching cold.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After dinner there is dancing on the court by the
young people. Anyway, Daddy is getting pretty
old for tennis.<span class="tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XII—DO INSECTS THINK?</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">In a recent book entitled, "The Psychic Life of
Insects," Professor Bouvier says that we must
be careful not to credit the little winged fellows with
intelligence when they behave in what seems like an
intelligent manner. They may be only reacting.
I would like to confront the Professor with an instance
of reasoning power on the part of an insect
which can not be explained away in any such
manner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">During the summer of 1899, while I was at work
on my treatise "Do Larvae Laugh," we kept a
female wasp at our cottage in the Adirondacks. It
really was more like a child of our own than a wasp,
except that it <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">looked</span> more like a wasp than a child
of our own. That was one of the ways we told the
difference.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was still a young wasp when we got it (thirteen
or fourteen years old) and for some time we could
not get it to eat or drink, it was so shy. Since it
was a, female, we decided to call it Miriam, but soon
the children&#39;s nickname for it—"Pudge"—became
<span class="tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a fixture, and "Pudge" it was from that time
on.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">One evening I had been working late in my
laboratory fooling round with some gin and other
chemicals, and in leaving the room I tripped over
a nine of diamonds which someone had left lying
on the floor and knocked over my card catalogue
containing the names and addresses of all the larvae
worth knowing in North America. The cards went
everywhere.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I was too tired to stop to pick them up that night,
and went sobbing to bed, just as mad as I could be.
As I went, however, I noticed the wasp flying about
in circles over the scattered cards. "Maybe Pudge
will pick them up," I said half-laughingly to myself,
never thinking for one moment that such would
be the case.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When I came down the next morning Pudge was
still asleep over in her box, evidently tired out.
And well she might have been. For there on the
floor lay the cards scattered all about just as I
had left them the night before. The faithful little
insect had buzzed about all night trying to come to
some decision about picking them up and arranging
them in the catalogue-box, and then, figuring out
for herself that, as she knew practically nothing
about larvae of any sort except wasp-larvae, she
<span class="tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would probably make more of a mess of rearranging
them than as if she left them on the floor for
me to fix. It was just too much for her to tackle,
and, discouraged, she went over and lay down in
her box, where she cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If this is not an answer to Professor Bouvier&#39;s
statement that insects have no reasoning power, I
do not know what is.<span class="tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XIII—THE SCORE IN THE STANDS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The opening week of the baseball season
brought out few surprises. The line-up in
the grandstands was practically the same as when
the season closed last Fall, most of the fans busying
themselves before the first game started by picking
old 1921 seat checks and October peanut crumbs
out of the pockets of their light-weight overcoats.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Old-timers on the two teams recognized the familiar
faces in the bleachers and were quick to give
them a welcoming cheer. The game by innings as
it was conducted by the spectators is as follows:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">FIRST INNING: Scanlon, sitting in the first-base
bleachers, yelled to Ruth to lead off with a
homer. Thibbets sharpened his pencil. Liebman
and O&#39;Rourke, in the south stand, engaged in a bitter
controversy over Peckingpaugh&#39;s last-season batting
average. NO RUNS.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">SECOND INNING: Scanlon yelled to Bodie to
to whang out a double. Turtelot said that Bodie
couldn&#39;t do it. Scanlon said "Oh, is that so?"
Turtelot said "Yes, that&#39;s so and whad&#39; yer know
<span class="tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>about that?" Bodie whanged out a double and
Scanlon&#39;s collar came undone and he lost his
derby. Stevens announced that this made Bodie&#39;s
batting average 1000 for the season so far. Joslin
laughed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">THIRD INNING: Thibbets sharpened his pencil.
Zinnzer yelled to Mays to watch out for a fast
one. Steinway yelled to Mays to watch out for a
slow one. Mays fanned. O&#39;Rourke called out and
asked Brazill how all the little brazil-nuts were.
Levy turned to O&#39;Rourke and said he&#39;d brazil-nut
him. O&#39;Rourke said "Eah? When do you start
doing it?" Levy said: "Right now." O&#39;Rourke
said: "All right, come on. I&#39;m waiting." Levy
said: "Eah?" O&#39;Rourke said: "Well, why don&#39;t
you come, you big haddock?" Levy said he&#39;d wait
for O&#39;Rourke outside where there weren&#39;t any ladies.
NO RUNS.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">FOURTH INNING: Scanlon called out to Ruth
to knock a homer, Thibbets sharpened his pencil.
Scanlon yelled: "Atta-boy, Babe, whad&#39; I tell
yer!" when Ruth got a single.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">FIFTH INNING: Mrs. Whitebait asked Mr.
Whitebait how you marked a home-run on the
score-card. Mr. Whitebait said: "Why do you
have to know? No one has knocked a home-run."
Mrs. Whitebait said that Babe Ruth ran home in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the last inning. "Yes, I know," said Mr. Whitebait,
"but it wasn&#39;t a home-run." Mrs. W. asked
him with some asperity just why it wasn&#39;t a home-run,
if a man ran home, especially if it was Babe
Ruth. Mr. W. said: "I&#39;ll tell you later. I want
to watch the game." Mrs. Whitebait began to cry
a little. Mr. Whitebait groaned and snatched the
card away from her and marked a home-run for
Ruth in the fourth inning.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">SIXTH INNING: Thurston called out to Hasty
not to let them fool him. Wicker said that where
Hasty got fooled in the first place was when he let
them tell him he could play baseball. Unknown
man said that he was "too Hasty," and laughed
very hard. Thurston said that Hasty was a better
pitcher than Mays, when he was in form. Unknown
man said "Eah?" and laughed very hard
again. Wicker asked how many times in seven years
Hasty was in form and Thurston replied: "Often
enough for you." Unknown man said that what
Hasty needed was some hasty-pudding, and laughed
so hard that his friend had to take him out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Thibbets sharpened his pencil.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">SEVENTH INNING: Libby called "Everybody
up!" as if he had just originated the idea,
and seemed proudly pleased when everyone stood
up. Taussig threw money to the boy for a bag of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>peanuts who tossed the bag to Levy who kept it.
Taussig to boy to Levy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Scanlon yelled to Ruth to come through with a
homer. Ruth knocked a single and Scanlon yelled
"Atta-boy, Babe! All-er way &#39;round! All-er way
round, Babe!" Mrs. Whitebait asked Mr. Whitebait
which were the Clevelands. Mr. Whitebait said
very quietly that the Clevelands weren&#39;t playing to-day,
just New York and Philadelphia and that only
two teams could play the game at the same time, that
perhaps next year they would have it so that Cleveland
and Philadelphia could both play New York at
once but the rules would have to be changed first.
Mrs. Whitebait said that he didn&#39;t have to be so
nasty about is. Mr. W. said My God, who&#39;s being
nasty? Mrs. W. said that the only reason she came
up with him anyway to see the Giants play was because
then she knew that he wasn&#39;t off with a lot of
bootleggers. Mr. W. said that it wasn&#39;t the Giants
but the Yankees that she was watching and where
did she get that bootlegger stuff. Mrs. W. said never
mind where she got it. NO RUNS.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">EIGHTH INNING: Thibbets sharpened his
pencil. Litner got up and went home. Scanlon
yelled to Ruth to end up the game with a homer.
Ruth singled. Scanlon yelled "Atta-Babe!" and
went home.<span class="tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">NINTH INNING: Stevens began figuring up
the players&#39; batting averages for the season thus far.
Wicker called over to Thurston and asked him how
Mr. Hasty was now. Thurston said "That&#39;s all
right how he is." Mrs. Whitebait said that she intended
to go to her sister&#39;s for dinner and that Mr.
Whitebait could do as he liked. Mr. Whitebait
told her to bet that he would do just that. Thibbets
broke his pencil.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Score: New York 11. Philadelphia 1.<span class="tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">These are melancholy days for the newspaper
sporting-writers. The complaints are
all in from old grads of Miami who feel that there
weren&#39;t enough Miami men on the All-American
football team, and it is too early to begin writing
about the baseball training camps. Once in a while
some lady swimmer goes around a tank three hundred
times, or the holder of the Class B squash
championship "meets all-comers in court tilt," but
aside from that, the sporting world is buried with
the nuts for the winter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Since sporting-writers must live, why not introduce
a few items of general interest into their columns,
accounts of the numerous contests of speed
and endurance which take place during the winter
months in the homes of our citizenry? For instance:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p class="tei tei-p">The nightly races between Mr. and Mrs. Theodore
M. Twamly, to see who can get into bed first, leaving
the opening of the windows and putting out of
the light for the loser, was won last night for the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>first time this winter by Mr. Twamly. Strategy
entered largely into the victory, Mr. Twamly getting
into bed with most of his clothes on.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p class="tei tei-p">An interesting exhibition of endurance was given
by Martin W. Lasbert at his home last evening
when he covered the distance between the cold-water
tap in his bath-room to the bedside of his young
daughter, Mertice, eighteen times in three hours,
this being the number of her demands for water
to drink. When interviewed after the eighteenth
lap, Mr. Lasbert said: "I wouldn&#39;t do it another
time, not if the child were parching." Shortly after
that he made his nineteenth trip.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As was exclusively predicted in these columns
yesterday and in accordance with all the dope,
Chester H. Flerlie suffered his sixtieth consecutive
defeat last evening at the hands of the American
Radiator Company, the builders of his furnace.
With all respect for Mr. Flerlie&#39;s pluck in attempting,
night after night, to dislodge clinkers caught
in the grate, it must be admitted, even by his host
of friends, that he might much better be engaged
in some gainful occupation. The grate tackled by
the doughty challenger last night was one of the
fine-tooth comb variety (the "Non-Sifto" No.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>114863), in which the clinker is caught by a patent
clutch and held securely until the wrecking-crew
arrives. At the end of the bout Mr. Flerlie was
led away to his dressing room, suffering from
lacerated hands and internal injuries. "I&#39;m

the match, it began to look as if the bantamweight

spoonfuls of the breakfast food over his shoulder

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XV—READING THE FUNNIES ALOUD</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">One of the minor enjoyable features of having
children is the necessity of reading aloud to
them the colored comic sections in the Sunday
papers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And no matter how good your intentions may
have been at first to keep the things out of the house
(the comic sections, not the children) sooner or
later there comes a Sunday when you find that your
little boy has, in some underground fashion, learned
of the raucous existence of <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Simon Simp</span> or the
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Breakback Babies</span>, and is demanding the current
installment with a fervor which will not be denied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sunday morning in our house has now become a
time for low subterfuge on the part of Doris and
me in our attempts to be somewhere else when
Junior appears dragging the "funnies" (a loathsome
term in itself) to be read to him. I make
believe that the furnace looks as if it might fall
apart at any minute if it is not watched closely, and
Doris calls from upstairs that she may be some time
over the weekly accounts.<span class="tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But sooner or later Junior ferrets one of us out
and presents himself beaming. "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Now</span> will you
read me the &#39;funnies&#39;?" is the dread sentence
which opens the siege. It then becomes a rather ill-natured
contest between Doris and me to see which
can pick the more bearable pages to read, leaving
the interminable ones, containing great balloons
pregnant with words, for the other.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I usually find that Doris has read the Briggs page
to Junior before I get downstairs, the Briggs page
(and possibly the drawings of Voight&#39;s <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Lester De
Pester</span>) being the only department that an adult
mind can dwell on and keep its self-respect. "Now
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">I</span> will read you Briggs," says Doris with the air of
an indulgent parent, but settling down with great
relish to the task, "and Daddy will read you the
others."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Having been stuck for over a year with "the
others" I have now reached a stage where I utilize
a sort of second sight in the reading whereby the
words are seen and pronounced without ever registering
on my brain at all. And, as I sit with Junior
impassive on my lap (just why children should so
frantically seek to have the "funnies" read to
them is a mystery, for they never by any chance
seem to derive the slightest emotional pleasure from
the recital but sit in stony silence as if they rather
<span class="tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>disapproved of the whole thing after all) I have
evolved a system which enables me to carry on a
little constructive thinking while reading aloud,
thereby keeping the time from being entirely
wasted. Heaven knows we get little enough opportunity
to sit down and think things out in this busy
work-a-day world, so that this little period of mental
freedom is in the nature of a godsend. Thus:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Here I am in the thirties
and it is high time that I made
something of myself. Is my
job as good as I deserve? By
studying nights I might fit
myself for a better position in
the foreign exchange department,
but that would mean an
outlay of money. Furthermore,
is it, on the whole, wise
to attempt to hurry the workings
of Fate? Is not perhaps
the determinist right who says
that what we are and what we
ever can be is already written
in the books, that we can not
alter the workings of Destiny
one iota? This theory is, of
course, tenable, but, on the

something to do. Schwül asks her how she would
like to have pass before her all the wonders of

rotten. He then suggests that Ringblattz, son of
Pflucht, be made to appear before her and fight a

Immerglück and she summons to her the four
dwarfs: Hot Water, Cold Water, Cool, and Cloudy.

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XVII—THE YOUNG IDEA&#39;S SHOOTING GALLERY</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Since we were determined to have Junior educated
according to modern methods of child
training, a year and a half did not seem too
early an age at which to begin. As Doris said:
"There is no reason why a child of a year and a
half shouldn&#39;t have rudimentary cravings for self-expression."
And really, there isn&#39;t any reason,
when you come right down to it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doris had been reading books on the subject, and
had been talking with Mrs. Deemster. Most of
the trouble in our town can be traced back to someone&#39;s
having been talking with Mrs. Deemster.
Mrs. Deemster brings an evangelical note into the
simplest social conversations, so that by the time
your wife is through the second piece of cinnamon
toast she is convinced that all children should have
their knee-pants removed before they are four, or
that you should hire four servants a day on three-hour
shifts, or that, as in the present case, no child
should be sent to a regular school until he has
<span class="tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>determined for himself what his profession is going
to be and then should be sent straight from the home
to Johns Hopkins or the Sorbonne.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Junior was to be left entirely to himself, the
theory being that he would find self-expression in
some form or other, and that by watching him carefully
it could be determined just what should be
developed in him, or, rather, just what he should be
allowed to develop in himself. He was not to be
corrected in any way, or guided, and he was to call
us "Doris" and "Monty" instead of "Mother"
and "Father." We were to be just pals, nothing
more. Otherwise, his individuality would become
submerged. I was, however, to be allowed to pay
what few bills he might incur until he should find
himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first month that Junior was "on his own,"
striving for self-expression, he spent practically
every waking hour of each day in picking the mortar
out from between the bricks in the fire-place and
eating it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t you think you ought to suggest to him
that nobody who really <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">is</span> anybody eats mortar?"
I said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t like to interfere," replied Doris. "I&#39;m
trying to figure out what it may mean. He may
have the makings of a sculptor in him." But one
<span class="tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>could see that she was a little worried, so I didn&#39;t
say the cheap and obvious thing, that at any rate
he had the makings of a sculpture in him or would
have in a few more days of self-expression.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Soft putty was put at his disposal, in case he
might feel like doing a little modeling. We didn&#39;t
expect much of him at first, of course; maybe just
a panther or a little General Sherman; but if that
was to be his <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">métier</span> we weren&#39;t going to have it said
that his career was nipped in the bud for the lack of
a little putty.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first thing that he did was to stop up the
keyhole in the bath-room door while I was in the
tub, so that I had to crawl out on the piazza roof
and into the guest-room window. It did seem as if
there might be some way of preventing a recurrence
of that sort of thing without submerging his individuality
too much. But Doris said no. If he were
disciplined now, he would grow up nursing a complex
against putty and against me and might even try
to marry Aunt Marian. She had read of a little boy
who had been punished by his father for putting
soap on the cellar stairs, and from that time on, all
the rest of his life, every time he saw soap he went
to bed and dreamed that he was riding in the cab
of a runaway engine dressed as Perriot, which meant,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of course, that he had a suppressed desire to kill his
father.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It almost seemed, however, as if the risk were
worth taking if Junior could be shown the fundamentally
anti-social nature of an act like stuffing
keyholes with putty, but nothing was done about it
except to take the putty supply away for that day.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The chief trouble came, however, in Junior&#39;s
contacts with other neighborhood children whose
parents had not seen the light. When Junior
would lead a movement among the young bloods
to pull up the Hemmings&#39; nasturtiums or would
show flashes of personality by hitting little Leda
Hemming over the forehead with a trowel, Mrs.
Hemming could never be made to see that to
reprimand Junior would be to crush out his God-given
individuality. All she would say was, "Just
look at those nasturtiums!" over and over again.
And the Hemming children were given to understand
that it would be all right if they didn&#39;t play
with Junior quite so much.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Deemster didn&#39;t enter into the spirit of the thing at all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This morning, however, the thing solved itself.
While expressing himself in putty in the nursery,
Junior succeeded in making a really excellent lifemask
of Mrs. Deemster&#39;s fourteen-months-old little
<span class="tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>girl who had come over to spend the morning with
him. She had a little difficulty in breathing, but it
really was a fine mask. Mrs. Deemster, however,
didn&#39;t enter into the spirit of the thing at all, and
after excavating her little girl, took Doris aside.
It was decided that Junior is perhaps too young to
start in on his career unguided.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That is Junior that you can hear now, I think.<span class="tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XVIII—POLYP WITH A PAST</h1>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head"><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="tei tei-hi">The Story Of An Organism With A Heart</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Of all forms of animal life, the polyp is probably
the most neglected by fanciers. People
seem willing to pay attention to anything, cats,
lizards, canaries, or even fish, but simply because
the polyp is reserved by nature and not given to
showing off or wearing its heart on its sleeve, it is
left alone under the sea to slave away at coral-building
with never a kind word or a pat on the
tentacles from anybody.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was quite by accident that I was brought face
to face with the human side of a polyp. I had
been working on a thesis on "Emotional Crises in
Sponge Life," and came upon a polyp formation on
a piece of coral in the course of my laboratory work.
To say that I was astounded would be putting it
mildly. I was surprised.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The difficulty in research work in this field came
in isolating a single polyp from the rest in order
to study the personal peculiarities of the little organism,
for, as is so often the case (even, I fear, with
<span class="tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>us great big humans sometimes), the individual
behaves in an entirely different manner in private
from the one he adopts when there is a crowd around.
And a polyp, among all creatures, has a minimum of
time to himself in which to sit down and think.
There is always a crowd of other polyps dropping
in on him, urging him to make a fourth in a string
of coral beads or just to come out and stick around
on a rock for the sake of good-fellowship.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The one which I finally succeeded in isolating
was an engaging organism with a provocative manner
and a little way of wrinkling up its ectoderm which
put you at once at your ease. There could be no
formality about your relations with this polyp five
minutes after your first meeting. You were just
like one great big family.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Although I have no desire to retail gossip, I think
that readers of this treatise ought to be made aware
of the fact (if, indeed, they do not already know
it) that a polyp is really neither one thing nor
another in matters of gender. One day it may be
a little boy polyp, another day a little girl, according
to its whim or practical considerations of policy.
On gray days, when everything seems to be going
wrong, it may decide that it will be neither boy nor
girl but will just drift. I think that if we big
human cousins of the little polyp were to follow
<span class="tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the example set by these lowliest of God&#39;s creatures
in this matter, we all would find, ourselves much
better off in the end. Am I not right, little polyp?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What was my surprise, then, to discover my little
friend one day in a gloomy and morose mood. It
refused the peanut-butter which I had brought it
and I observed through the microscope that it was
shaking with sobs. Lifting it up with a pair of
pincers I took it over to the window to let it watch
the automobiles go by, a diversion which had, in the
past, never failed to amuse. But I could see that
it was not interested. A tune from the victrola fell
equally flat, even though I set my little charge on
the center of the disc and allowed it to revolve at
a dizzy pace, which frolic usually sent it into spasms
of excited giggling. Something was wrong. It was
under emotional stress of the most racking kind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I consulted Klunzinger&#39;s "Die Korallenthiere des
Rothen Meeres" and there found that at an early
age the polyp is quite likely to become the victim
of a sentimental passion which is directed at its
own self.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In other words, my tiny companion was in love
with itself, bitterly, desperately, head-over-heels in
love.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In an attempt to divert it from this madness, I
took it on an extended tour of the Continent, visiting
<span class="tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>all the old cathedrals and stopping at none but the
best hotels. The malady grew worse, instead of
better. I thought that perhaps the warm sun of
Granada would bring the color back into those pale
tentacles, but there the inevitable romance in the
soft air was only fuel to the flame, and, in the
shadow of the Alhambra, my little polyp gave up
the fight and died of a broken heart without ever
having declared its love to itself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I returned to America shortly after not a little
chastened by what I had witnessed of Nature&#39;s wonders
in the realm of passion.<span class="tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The reliance of young mothers on Dr. Emmett
Holt&#39;s "The Care and Feeding of Children,"
has become a national custom. Especially during
the early infancy of the first baby does the
son rise and set by what "Holt says." But there
are several questions which come to mind which
are not included in the handy questionnaire
arranged by the noted child-specialist, and as he is
probably too busy to answer them himself, we have
compiled an appendix which he may incorporate in
the next edition of his book, if he cares to. Of
course, if he doesn&#39;t care to it isn&#39;t compulsory.</p>

A bath should never be given a child until at least
<span class="tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>one hour after eating (that is, after the parent has

of bathing children?</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They are too easily swallowed, and after six or
seven wet face-cloths have been swallowed, the child
is likely to become heavy and lethargic.</p>

to turn it too tight or the child will resent it; but on

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XX—THE COMMITTEE ON THE WHOLE</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">A new plan has just been submitted for running
the railroads. That makes one hundred
and eleven.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The present suggestion involves the services of
some sixteen committees. Now presumably the
idea is to get the roses back into the cheeks of the
railroads, so that they will go running about from
place to place again and perhaps make a little
money on pleasant Saturdays and Sundays. But if
these proposed committees are anything like other
committees which we have had to do with, the following
will be a fair example of how our railroads
will be run.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The sub-committee on the Punching of Rebate
Slips will have a meeting called for five o&#39;clock in
the private grill room at the Pan-American Building.
Postcards will have been sent out the day before
by the Secretary, saying: "Please try to be
present as there are several important matters to be
brought up." This will so pique the curiosity of
the members that they will hardly be able to wait
<span class="tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>until five o&#39;clock. One will come at four o&#39;clock by
mistake and, after steaming up and down the corridor
for half an hour, will go home and send in his
resignation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At 5:10 the Secretary will bustle in with a briefcase
and a map showing the weather areas over the
entire United States for the preceding year. He will
be very warm from hurrying.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At 5:15 two members of the committee will stroll
in, one of them saying to the other: "—so the
Irishman turns to the Jew and says: &#39;Well, I knew
your father before that!&#39; Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! &#39;I
knew your father before that!&#39;"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They will then seat themselves at one end of the
committee-table, just as another member comes
hurrying in. Time 5:21.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">One of the story-tellers being the Chairman, he
will pound half-heartedly on the table and say: "As
some of us have to get away early, I think that
we had better begin now, although Mr. Entwhistle
and Dr. Pearly are not here."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I met Dr. Pearly last night at the Vegetarian
Club dinner," says one of the members, "and he
said that he might be a little late today but that he
would surely come."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"His wife has just had a very delicate throat
operation, I understand," offers a committeeman
<span class="tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>who is drawing concentric circles on his pad of
paper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Bad weather for throat operations," says the
Secretary.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s right," says the Chairman, looking
through a pile of papers for one which he has left
at home. "But let&#39;s get down to business. At the
last meeting the question arose as to whether or
not it was advisable to continue having conductors
punch the little hole at the bottom of rebate slips.
As you know, the slip says, &#39;Not redeemable if
punched here.&#39; Now, someone brought up the point
that it seems silly to give out a rebate slip at all if
there isn&#39;t going to be any rebate on it. A sub-committee
was appointed to go into the matter, and
I would like to ask Mr. Twing, the chairman, what
he has to report."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. Twing will clear his throat and start to
speak, but will make only an abortive sound. He
will then clear his throat again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mr. Chairman, the other members of the sub-committee
and myself were unable to get exactly the
data on this that we wanted and I delegated Mr.
Entwhistle to dig up something which he said he
had read recently in the files of the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Scientific American.</span>
But Mr. Entwhistle doesn&#39;t seem to be here
today, and so I am unable to report his findings.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>It was, however, the sense of the meeting that the
conductors should not."</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image08" id="image08" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image08.png" alt="&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; says the chairman." class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s right," says the chairman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Should not what?" inquires Dr. Pearly, who
has just sneaked in, knocking three hats to the floor
while hanging up his coat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dr. Pearly is never answered, for the Chairman
looks at his watch and says: "I&#39;m very sorry, gentlemen,
but I have an appointment at 5:45 and
must be going. Supposing I appoint a sub-committee
consisting of Dr. Pearly, Mr. Twing and Mr.
Berry, to find Mr. Entwhistle and see what he
dug out of the files of the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Scientific American.</span>
Then, at the next meeting we can have a report
from both sub-committees and will also hear from
Professor McKlicktric, who has just returned from
Panama.... A motion to adjourn is now in order.
Do I hear such a motion?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After listening carefully, he hears it, and the railroads
run themselves for another week.<span class="tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXI—NOTING AN INCREASE IN BIGAMY</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Either more men are marrying more wives
than ever before, or they are getting more
careless about it. During the past week bigamy
has crowded baseball out of the papers, and while
this may be due in part to the fact that it was a
cold, rainy week and little baseball could be played,
yet there is a tendency to be noted there somewhere.
All those wishing to note a tendency will
continue on into the next paragraph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is, of course, nothing new in bigamy. Anyone
who goes in for it with the idea of originating
a new fad which shall be known by his name, like
the daguerreotype or potatoes O&#39;Brien, will have to
reckon with the priority claims of several hundred
generations of historical characters, most of them
wearing brown beards. Just why beards and
bigamy seem to have gone hand in hand through
the ages is a matter for the professional humorists
to determine. We certainly haven&#39;t got time to do it
here.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But the multiple-marriages unearthed during the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>past week have a certain homey flavor lacking in
some of those which have gone before. For instance,
the man in New Jersey who had two wives
living right with him all of the time in the same
apartment. No need for subterfuge here, no deceiving
one about the other. It was just a matter
of walking back and forth between the dining-room
and the study. This is, of course, bigamy under
ideal conditions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But in tracing a tendency like this, we must not
deal so much with concrete cases as with drifts and
curves. A couple of statistics are also necessary,
especially if it is an alarming tendency that is being
traced. The statistics follow, in alphabetical
order:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the United States during the years 1918-1919
there were 4,956,673 weddings. 2,485,845 of these
were church weddings, strongly against the wishes
of the bridegrooms concerned. In these weddings
10,489,392 silver olive-forks were received as gifts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Starting with these figures as a basis, we turn to
the report of the Pennsylvania State Committee on
Outdoor Gymnastics for the year beginning January
4th, 1920, and ending a year later.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This report being pretty fairly uninteresting, we
leave it and turn to another report, which covers
the manufacture and sale of rugs. This has a
<span class="tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>picture of a rug in it, and a darned good likeness
it is, too.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In this rug report we find that it takes a Navajo
Indian only eleven days to weave a rug 12 x 5, with
a swastika design in the middle. Eleven days. It
seems incredible. Why, it takes only 365 days to
make a year!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now, having seen that there are 73,000 men and
women in this country today who can neither read
nor write, and that of these only 4%, or a little over
half, are colored, what are we to conclude? What
is to be the effect on our national morale? Who
is to pay this gigantic bill for naval armament?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Before answering these questions any further
than this, let us quote from an authority on the
subject, a man who has given the best years, or at
any rate some very good years, of his life to research
in this field, and who now takes exactly the
stand which we have been outlining in this article.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I would not," he says in a speech delivered
before the Girls&#39; Friendly Society of Laurel Hill,
"I would not for one minute detract from the glory
of those who have brought this country to its
present state of financial prominence among the
nations of the world, and yet as I think back on
those dark days, I am impelled to voice the protest
of millions of American citizens yet unborn."<span class="tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Perhaps some of our little readers remember
what the major premise of this article was. If so,
will they please communicate with the writer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Oh, yes! Bigamy!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Well, it certainly is funny how many cases of
bigamy you hear about nowadays. Either more
men are marrying more wives than ever before, or
they are getting more careless about it. (That
sounds very, very familiar. It is barely possible
that it is the sentence with which this article opens.
We say so many things in the course of one article
that repetitions are quite likely to creep in).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At any rate, the tendency seems to be toward
an increase in bigamy.<span class="tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p class="tei tei-p">Much time has been devoted of late by ardent biographers
to shedding light on misunderstood characters
in history, especially British rulers. We cannot let
injustice any longer be done to King Wiglaf, the much-maligned
monarch of central Britain in the early Ninth Century.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The fall of the kingdom of Mercia in 828 under the
the onslaughts of Ecgberht the West-Saxon, have been
laid to Wiglaf&#39;s untidy personal habits and his alleged
mania for practical joking. The accompanying biographical
sketch may serve to disclose some of the more
intimate details of the character of the man and to alter
in some degree history&#39;s unfavorable estimate of him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">Our first glimpse of the Wiglaf who was one
day to become ruler of Mercia, the heart of
present-day England (music, please), is when at
the age of seven he was taken by Oswier, his father&#39;s
murderer, to see Mrs. Siddons play <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Lady Macbeth.</span>
(Every subject of biographical treatment, regardless
of the period in which he or she lived, must have
been taken at an early age to see Mrs. Siddons
play <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Lady Macbeth.</span> It is part of the code of
biography.)<span class="tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">While sitting in the royal box, the young prince
Wiglaf was asked what he thought of the performance.
"Rotten!" he answered, and left the place
abruptly, setting fire to the building as he went out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Beobald, in citing the above incident in his
"Chronicles of Comical Kings," calls it "an hendy
hap ichabbe y-hent." And perhaps he&#39;s right.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Events proceeded in rapid succession after this
for the young boy and we next find him facing
marriage with a stiff upper-lip. Mystery has always
surrounded the reasons which led to the choice of
Princess Offa as Wiglaf&#39;s bride. In fact, it has
never been quite certain whether or not she <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">was</span>
his bride. No one ever saw them together.<a name="noteref_1" id="noteref_1"></a><a href="#note_1"><span class="footnoteref">1</span></a> On
several occasions he is reported to have asked his
chamberlain who she was as she passed by on the
street.<a name="noteref_2" id="noteref_2"></a><a href="#note_2"><span class="footnoteref">2</span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And yet the theory persists that she was his wife,
owing doubtless to the fact that on the eve of the
Battle of Otford he sent a message to her asking
where "in God&#39;s name" his clean shirts had been
put when they came back from the wash.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">We come now to that period in Wiglaf&#39;s life which
has been for so many centuries the cause of historical
<span class="tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>speculation, pro and con. The reference is,
of course, to his dealings with Aethelbald, the
ambassador from Wessex. Every schoolboy has
taken part in the Wiglaf-Aethelbald controversy,
but how many really know the inside facts of the
case?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Examination of the correspondence between these
two men shows Wiglaf to have been simply a great,
big-hearted, overgrown boy in the whole affair. All
claims of his having had an eye on the throne of
Northumbria fade away under the delightful ingenuousness
of his attitude as expressed in these
letters.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I should of thought," he writes in 821 to his
sister, "that anyone who was not cock-ide drunk
would have known better than to of tried to walk
bear-foot through that eel-grass from the beech up
to the bath-house without sneekers on, which is
what that ninn Aethelbald tryed to do this AM.
Well say laffter is no name for what you would of
done if you had seen him. He looked like he was
trying to walk a tide-rope. Hey I yelled at him
all the way, do you think you are trying to walk a
tide-rope? Well say maybe that didn&#39;t make him
sore."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Shortly after this letter was written, Wiglaf ascended
the throne of Mercia, his father having
<span class="tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>disappeared Saturday night without trace. A
peasant<a name="noteref_3" id="noteref_3"></a><a href="#note_3"><span class="footnoteref">3</span></a> some years after said that he met the old
king walking along a road near what is now the
Scottish border, telling people that he was carrying
a letter of greeting from the Mayor of Pontygn to
the Mayor of Langoscgirh. Others say that he fell
into the sea off the coast of Wales and became what
is now known as King&#39;s Rocks. This last has never
been authenticated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At any rate, the son, on ascending the throne, became
king. His first official act was to order dinner.
"A nice, juicy steak," he is said to have called for,<a name="noteref_4" id="noteref_4"></a><a href="#note_4"><span class="footnoteref">4</span></a>
"French fries, apple pie and a cup of coffee." It
is probable that he really said "a coff of cuppee,"
however, as he was a wag of the first water and
loved a joke as well as the next king.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">We are now thrown into the maelstrom of contradictory
historical data, some of which credits
Wiglaf with being the greatest ruler Mercia ever had
and some of which indicates that he was nothing
but a royal bum. It is not the purpose of this biography
to try to settle the dispute. All we know
for a fact is that he was a very human man who had
faults like the rest of us and that shortly after becoming
king he disappears from view.<span class="tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His reign began at 4 P.M. one Wednesday (no,
Thursday) afternoon and early the next morning
Mercia was overrun by the West-Saxons. It is
probable that King Wiglaf was sold for old silver
to help pay expenses.<span class="tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXIII—FACING THE BOYS&#39; CAMP PROBLEM</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The time seemed to have come to send Junior
away to a boys&#39; camp for the summer. He
was getting too large to have about the house during
the hot weather, and besides, getting him out of
town seemed the only way to stop the radio concerts
which had been making a continuous Chautauqua
of our home-life ever since March.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I therefore got out a magazine and turned to that
section of the advertising headed, "Summer Camps
and Schools." There was a staggering array. Judging
from the photographs the entire child population
of the United States spent last summer in bathing
suits or on horseback, and the pictures of them were
so generic and familiar-looking that there was a
great temptation to spend the evening scrutinizing
them closely to see if you could pick out anyone
you knew.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Come on, read some out loud," said Doris in
her practical way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;The Nooga-Wooga Camps,&#39;" I began. "&#39;The
<span class="tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Garden Spot of the Micasset Mountains. Tumbling
water, calls of birds, light-hearted laughter, horseback
rides along shady trails, lasting friendships—all
these are the heritage of happy days at Nooga-Wooga.&#39; ... I
don&#39;t think much of the costumes
they give the boys to wear at Nooga-Wooga. They
look rather sissy to me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s because you are looking at the Camps for
Girls, dear," said Doris. "Those are girls in Peter
Thompsons and bloomers."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Hurriedly turning the page, I came to Camps for
Boys.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Camp Wicomagisset, for Manly Boys. On famous
Lake Pogoniblick in the heart of the far-famed
Wappahammock district. Campfire stories, military
drill, mountain climbing, swimming, wading,
hiking, log-cabins, sailing—&#39; they say nothing about
horseshoeing. Don&#39;t you suppose they teach horseshoeing?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That probably comes in the second year for
the older boys," said Doris. "I wouldn&#39;t want
Junior to plunge right into horseshoeing his first
season. We mustn&#39;t rush him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Camp Wad-ne-go-gallup on the shores of
Crisco Bay, Maine. Facing that grandest of all
oceans, the Atlantic. Located among the best farms
where fresh and wholesome food can be had in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>abundance&#39;—yes but <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">is</span> it had, my dear? That&#39;s
the question. Anyway, I don&#39;t like the looks of
the boat in the picture. It&#39;s too full of boys."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Opossum Mountain Camp for Boys. Unusual
sports and trips&#39;—Ah, possibly condor stalking!
That certainly would be unusual. But dangerous!
I&#39;d hate to think of Junior crawling about
over ledges, stalking condors. And it says here
that there is a dietitian and a camp-mother, as well."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Camp-mother?" Doris sniffed, "Probably she
thinks she knows how to bring up children—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Just then Junior came in to announce that he
had signed up for a job for the summer, working
on the farm of Eddie Westover&#39;s uncle. So in view
of this added income, I felt that I could afford a
little vacation myself, and am leaving on July 1st
for Camp Mionogonett in the foothills of the Rokomokos,

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXIV—ALL ABOUT THE SILESIAN PROBLEM</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">So much controversy has been aroused over
Silesia it is high time that the average man in
this country had a clearer idea of the problem.
At present many people think that if you add oxygen
to Silesia you will get oxide of silesia and can
take spots out of clothes with it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A definite statement of the whole Upper Silesian
question is therefore due, and, for those who care
to listen, about to be made.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The trouble started at the treaty of Noblitz in
1773. You have no idea what a perfectly rotten
treaty that was. It was negotiated by the Grand
Duke Ludwig of Saxe-Goatherd-Cobalt, whose sister
married a Morrisey and settled in Fall River.
The aim and ambition of Ludwig&#39;s life was to annex
Spielzeugingen to Nichtrauschen, thereby augmenting
his duchy and at the same time having a dandy
time. And he was the kind of man who would stop
at nothing when it came time to augment his duchy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In this treaty, then, Ludwig insisted on a clause
<span class="tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>making Silesia a monogamy. This was very clever,
as it brought the Centrist party in Silesia into direct
conflict with the party who wanted to restore the
young Prince Niblick to the throne; thereby causing
no end of trouble and nasty feeling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">With these obstacles out of the way, the greed
and ambition of Ludwig were practically unrestrained.
In fact, some historians say that they
knew no bounds. Summoning the Storkrath, or
common council (composed of three classes: the
nobles, the welterweights, and the licensed pilots)
he said to them: (according to Taine)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"An army can travel ten days on its stomach,
but who the hell wants to be an army?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This saying has become a by-word in history
and is now remembered long after the Grand Duke
Ludwig has been forgotten. But at the time, Ludwig
received nothing short of an ovation for it,
and succeeded in winning over the obstructionists
to his side. This made everyone in favor of his
disposition of Silesia except the Silesians. And, as
they could neither read nor write, they thought
that they still belonged to Holland and cheered a
dyke every time they saw one.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The question remained in abeyance therefore, for
a century and a quarter. Then, in 1805, three
years after the accession of Ralph Rittenhouse to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the throne of England, the storm broke again. The
occasion was the partition of Parchesie by the Great
Powers, by which the towns of Zweiback, Ulmhausen
and Ost Wilp were united to form what is
known as the "industrial triangle" on the Upper
Silesian border. These towns are situated in the
heart of the pumice district and could alone supply
France and Germany with pumice for fifty years,
provided it didn&#39;t rain. Bismarck once called Ost
Wilp "the pumice heart of the world," and he was
about right, too.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It will therefore be seen how important it was to
France that this "industrial triangle" on the Silesian
border should belong to Germany. At the conference
which designated the border line, Gambetta,
representing France, insisted that the line should
follow the course of the Iser River ("iser on one
side or the other," was the way he is reported to
have phrased it), which would divide the pumice
deposits into three areas, the fourth being the
dummy. This would never do.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Experts were called in to see if it might not be
possible to so divide the district that France might
get a quarter, Germany a quarter and England
fifty cents. It was suggested that the line be drawn
down through Globe-Wernicke to the mouth of the
Iser. As Gambetta said, the line had to be drawn
<span class="tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>somewhere and it might as well be there. But Lord
Hay-Paunceforte, representing England, refused to
concede the point and for a time it looked like an
open breach. But matters were smoothed over by
the holding of a plebiscite in all the towns of Upper
Silesia. The result of this plebiscite was taken and
exactly reversed by the council, so that the entire
Engadine Valley was given to Sweden, who didn&#39;t
want it anyway.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And there the matter now stands.<span class="tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXV—"HAPPY THE HOME WHERE BOOKS ARE FOUND"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">By way of egging people on to buy Dr. Eliot&#39;s
Five Foot Shelf of books, the publishers are
resorting to an advertisement in which are depicted
two married couples, one reading together by the
library table, the other playing some two-handed
game of cards which is evidently boring them considerably.
The query is "Which One of These
Couples Will be the Happier in Five Years?" the
implication being that the young people who buy
Dr. Eliot&#39;s books will, by constant reading aloud
to each other from the works of the world&#39;s
best writers, cement a companionship which will
put to shame the illiterate union of the young card
players.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Granted that most two-handed games of cards <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">are</span>
dull enough to result in divorce at the end of five
years, they cannot be compared to co-operative
family reading as a system of home-wrecking. If
this were a betting periodical, we would have ten
dollars to place on the chance of the following
<span class="tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>being the condition of affairs in the literary family

<p class="tei tei-p">(<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">The husband is reading his evening newspaper.

never get along in this Darwin if we don&#39;t begin

<p class="tei tei-p">HUSBAND: It&#39;s not over my head at all. It&#39;s just

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXVI—WHEN NOT IN ROME, WHY DO AS THE ROMANS DID?</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is a growing sentiment among sign
painters that when a sign or notice is to be
put up in a public place it should be written in characters
that are at least legible, so that, to quote
"The Manchester Guardian" (as every one seems
to do) "He who runs may read."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This does not strike one as being an unseemly
pandering to popular favor. The supposition is
that the sign is put there to be read, otherwise it
would have been turned over to an inmate of the
Odd Fellows Home to be engraved on the head of
a pin. And what could be a more fair requirement
than that it should be readable?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Advertising, with its billboard message of rustless
screens and co-educational turkish-baths, has
done much to further the good cause, and a glance
through the files of newspapers of seventy-five
years ago, when the big news story of the day was
played up in diamond type easily deciphered in
a strong light with the naked eye, shows that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>news printing has not, to use a slang phrase, stood
still.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But in the midst of this uniform progress we
find a stagnant spot. Surrounded by legends that
are patent and easy to read and understand, we find
the stone-cutter and the architect still putting up
tablets and cornerstones, monuments and cornices,
with dates disguised in Roman numerals. It is as
if it were a game, in which they were saying, "The
number we are thinking of is even; it begins with
M; it has five digits and when they are spread out,
end to end, they occupy three feet of space. You
have until we count to one hundred to guess what
it is."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Roman numerals are all right for a rainy Sunday
afternoon or to take a convalescent&#39;s mind from his
illness, but to put them in a public place, where the
reader stands a good chance of being run over by a
dray if he spends more than fifty seconds in their
perusal, is not in keeping with the efficiency of the
age. If for no other reason than the extra space
they take, involving more marble, more of the cutter&#39;s
time and wear and tear on his instruments,
not to mention the big overhead, you would think
that Roman numerals would have been abolished
long ago.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Of course, they can be figured out if you&#39;re good
<span class="tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at that sort of thing. By working on your cuff and
backs of envelopes, you can translate them in no
time at all compared to the time taken by a cocoon
to change into a butterfly, for instance. All you
have to do is remember that "M" stands for either
"<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">millium</span>," meaning thousand, or for "million."
By referring to the context you can tell which is
more probable. If, for example, it is a date, you
can tell right away that it doesn&#39;t mean "million,"
for there isn&#39;t any "million" in our dates. And
there is one-seventh or eighth of your number deciphered
already. Then "C," of course, stands for
"<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">centum</span>," which you can translate by working
backwards at it, taking such a word as "century"
or "per cent," and looking up what they come
from, and there you have it! By this time it is
hardly the middle of the afternoon, and all you
have before you is a combination of X&#39;s, I&#39;s and an
L, the latter standing for "Elevated Railway," and
"Licorice," or, if you cross it with two little horizontal
lines, it stands for the English pound, which
is equivalent to about four dollars and eighty-odd
cents in real money. Simple as sawing through
a log.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But it takes time. That&#39;s the big trouble with
it. You can&#39;t do the right thing by the office and
go in for Roman numerals, too. And since most
<span class="tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the people who pass such inscriptions are
dependent on their own earnings, why not cater
to them a bit and let them in on the secret?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Probably the only reason that the people haven&#39;t
risen up and demanded a reform along these lines
is because so few of them really give a hang what
the inscription says. If the American Antiquarian
Turn-Verein doesn&#39;t care about stating in understandable
figures the date on which the cornerstone
of their building was laid, the average citizen is
perfectly willing to let the matter drop right there.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But it would never do to revert to Roman numerals
in, say, the arrangement of time-tables. How
long would the commuter stand it if he had to
mumble to himself for twenty minutes and use up
the margins of his newspaper before he could figure
out what was the next train after the 5:18? Or
this, over the telephone between wife and husband:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Batting averages and the standing of teams in
the leagues are another department where the introduction
of Roman numerals would be suicide for
the political party in power at the time. For of all
things that are essential to the day&#39;s work of the
voter, an early enlightenment in the matter of the
home team&#39;s standing and the numerical progress
of the favorite batsman are of primary importance.
This information has to be gleaned on the way to
work in the morning, and, except for those who
come in to work each day from North Philadelphia
or the Croton Reservoir, it would be a physical
impossibility to figure the tables out and get any
of the day&#39;s news besides.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">YOU CAN&#39;T DO RIGHT BY THE OFFICE AND GO IN FOR ROMAN NUMERALS TOO.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p">On matters such as these the proletariat would
have protested the Roman numeral long ago. If
they are willing to let its reactionary use on tablets
and monuments stand it is because of their indifference
to influences which do not directly affect
their pocketbooks. But if it could be put up to
them in a powerful cartoon, showing the Architect
and the Stone-Cutter dressed in frock coats and
silk hats, with their pockets full of money, stepping
on the Common People so that he cannot see what
is written on the tablet behind them, then perhaps
the public would realize how they are being imposed
on.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For that there is an organized movement among
architects and stone-cutters to keep these things
from the citizenry there can no longer be any doubt.
It is not only a matter of the Roman numerals.
How about the use of the "V" when "U" should
be used? You will always see it in inscriptions.
"SVMNER BVILDING" is one of the least offensive.
Perhaps the excuse is that "V" is more
adapted to stone-lettering. Then why not carry
this principle out further? Why not use the letter
H when S is meant? Or substitute K for B? If
the idea is to deceive, and to make it easier for the
stone-cutter, a pleasing effect could be got from
the inscription, "Erected in 1897 by the Society
<span class="tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of Arts and Grafts", by making it read: "EKEATEW
IZ MXIXLXIXLXXII LY THE XNLIEZY
OF AEXA ZNL ELAFTX." There you have
letters that are all adapted to stone-cutting; they
look well together, and they are, in toto, as intelligible
as most inscriptions.<span class="tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXVII—THE TOOTH, THE WHOLE TOOTH, AND
NOTHING BUT THE TOOTH</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Some well-known saying (it doesn&#39;t make much
difference what) is proved by the fact that
everyone likes to talk about his experiences at the
dentist&#39;s. For years and years little articles like
this have been written on the subject, little jokes
like some that I shall presently make have been
made, and people in general have been telling other
people just what emotions they experience when
they crawl into the old red plush guillotine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They like to explain to each other how they feel
when the dentist puts "that buzzer thing" against
their bicuspids, and, if sufficiently pressed, they will
describe their sensations on mouthing a rubber dam.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ll tell you what I hate," they will say with
great relish, "when he takes that little nut-pick
and begins to scrape. Ugh!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s worse than that," says
the friend, not to be outdone, "when he is poking
around careless-like, and strikes a nerve. Wow!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And if there are more than two people at the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>experience-meeting, everyone will chip in and tell
what he or she considers to be the worst phase of
the dentist&#39;s work, all present enjoying the narration
hugely and none so much as the narrator who
has suffered so.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This sort of thing has been going on ever since
the first mammoth gold tooth was hung out as a
bait to folks in search of a good time. (By the
way, when <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">did</span> the present obnoxious system of dentistry
begin? It can&#39;t be so very long ago that the
electric auger was invented, and where would a
dentist be without an electric auger? Yet you
never hear of Amalgam Filling Day, or any other
anniversary in the dental year). There must be
a conspiracy of silence on the part of the trade to
keep hidden the names of the men who are responsible
for all this.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">However many years it may be that dentists have
been plying their trade, in all that time people have
never tired of talking about their teeth. This is
probably due to the inscrutable workings of Nature
who is always supplying new teeth to talk about.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As a matter of fact, the actual time and suffering
in the chair is only a fraction of the gross expenditure
connected with the affair. The preliminary
period, about which nobody talks, is much the
worse. This dates from the discovery of the wayward
<span class="tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tooth and extends to the moment when the
dentist places his foot on the automatic hoist which
jacks you up into range. Giving gas for tooth-extraction
is all very humane in its way, but the
time for anaesthetics is when the patient first decides
that he must go to the dentist. From then
on, until the first excavation is started, should be
shrouded in oblivion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is probably no moment more appalling than
that in which the tongue, running idly over the
teeth in a moment of care-free play, comes suddenly
upon the ragged edge of a space from which the
old familiar filling has disappeared. The world
stops and you look meditatively up to the corner
of the ceiling. Then quickly you draw your tongue
away, and try to laugh the affair off, saying to
yourself:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Stuff and nonsense, my good fellow! There is
nothing the matter with your tooth. Your nerves
are upset after a hard day&#39;s work, that&#39;s all."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Having decided this to your satisfaction, you
slyly, and with a poor attempt at being casual,
slide the tongue back along the line of adjacent
teeth, hoping against hope that it will reach the
end without mishap.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But there it is! There can be no doubt about
it this time. The tooth simply has got to be filled
<span class="tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by someone, and the only person who can fill it
with anything permanent is a dentist. You wonder
if you might not be able to patch it up yourself for
the time being,—a year or so—perhaps with a
little spruce-gum and a coating of new-skin. It is
fairly far back, and wouldn&#39;t have to be a very
sightly job.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But this has an impracticable sound, even to you.
You might want to eat some peanut-brittle (you
never can tell when someone might offer you
peanut-brittle these days), and the new-skin, while
serviceable enough in the case of cream soups and
custards, couldn&#39;t be expected to stand up under
heavy crunching.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">So you admit that, since the thing has got to
be filled, it might as well be a dentist who does the
job.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This much decided, all that is necessary is to
call him up and make an appointment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Let us say that this resolve is made on Tuesday.
That afternoon you start to look up the dentist&#39;s
number in the telephone-book. A great wave of
relief sweeps over you when you discover that it
isn&#39;t there. How can you be expected to make an
appointment with a man who hasn&#39;t got a telephone?
And how can you have a tooth filled without
making an appointment? The whole thing is
<span class="tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>impossible, and that&#39;s all there is to it. God knows
you did your best.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On Wednesday there is a slightly more insistent
twinge, owing to bad management of a sip of ice
water. You decide that you simply must get in
touch with that dentist when you get back from
lunch. But you know how those things are. First
one thing and then another came up, and a man
came in from Providence who had to be shown
around the office, and by the time you had a minute
to yourself it was five o&#39;clock. And, anyway, the
tooth didn&#39;t bother you again. You wouldn&#39;t be
surprised if, by being careful, you could get along
with it as it is until the end of the week when you
will have more time. A man has to think of his
business, after all, and what is a little personal
discomfort in the shape of an unfilled tooth to the
satisfaction of work well done in the office?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">By Saturday morning you are fairly reconciled
to going ahead, but it is only a half day and probably
he has no appointments left, anyway. Monday
is really the time. You can begin the week
afresh. After all, Monday is really the logical day
to start in going to the dentist.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Bright and early Monday morning you make
another try at the telephone-book, and find, to your
horror, that some time between now and last Tuesday
<span class="tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the dentist&#39;s name and number have been
inserted into the directory. There it is. There is
no getting around it: "Burgess, Jas. Kendal, DDS.... Courtland—2654".
There is really nothing
left to do but to call him up. Fortunately the line
is busy, which gives you a perfectly good excuse
for putting it over until Tuesday. But on Tuesday
luck is against you and you get a clear connection
with the doctor himself. An appointment
is arranged for Thursday afternoon at 3:30.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Thursday afternoon, and here it is only Tuesday
morning! Almost anything may happen between
now and then. We might declare war on Mexico,
and off you&#39;d have to go, dentist appointment or no
dentist appointment. Surely a man couldn&#39;t let
a date to have a tooth filled stand in the way of his
doing his duty to his country. Or the social revolution
might start on Wednesday, and by Thursday
the whole town might be in ashes. You can picture
yourself standing, Thursday afternoon at 3.30 on
the ruins of the City Hall, fighting off marauding
bands of reds, and saying to yourself, with a sigh
of relief: "Only to think! At this time I was to
have been climbing into the dentist&#39;s chair!" You
never can tell when your luck will turn in a thing
like that.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Wednesday goes by and nothing happens.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>And Thursday morning dawns without even a word
from the dentist saying that he has been called
suddenly out of town to lecture before the Incisor
Club. Apparently, everything is working against
you.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">By this time, your tongue has taken up a permanent
resting-place in the vacant tooth, and is
causing you to talk indistinctly and incoherently.
Somehow you feel that if the dentist opens your
mouth and finds the tip of your tongue in the tooth,
he will be deceived and go away without doing anything.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The only thing left is for you to call him up and
say that you have just killed a man and are being
arrested and can&#39;t possibly keep your appointment.
But any dentist would see through that. He would
laugh right into his transmitter at you. There is
probably no excuse which it would be possible to
invent which a dentist has not already heard eighty
or ninety times. No, you might as well see the
thing through now.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Luncheon is a ghastly rite. The whole left side
of your jaw has suddenly developed an acute sensitiveness
and the disaffection has spread to the four
teeth on either side of the original one. You doubt
if it will be possible for him to touch it at all.
Perhaps all he intends to do this time is to look at
<span class="tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it anyway. You might even suggest that to him.
You could very easily come in again soon and have
him do the actual work.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Three-thirty draws near. A horrible time of day
at best. Just when a man&#39;s vitality is lowest. Before
stepping in out of the sunlight into the
building in which the dental parlor is, you take one
look about you at the happy people scurrying by
in the street. Carefree children that they are!
What do they know of Life? Probably that man
in the silly-looking hat never had trouble with so
much as his baby-teeth. There they go, pushing
and jostling each other, just as if within ten feet
of them there was not a man who stands on the
brink of the Great Misadventure. Ah well! Life
is like that!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Into the elevator. The last hope is gone. The
door clangs and you look hopelessly about you at
the stupid faces of your fellow passengers. How
can people be so clownish? Of course, there is
always the chance that the elevator will fall and
that you will all be terribly hurt. But that is too
much to expect. You dismiss it from your thoughts
as too impractical, too visionary. Things don&#39;t
work out as happily as that in real life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">You feel a certain glow of heroic pride when you
tell the operator the right floor number. You might
<span class="tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>just as easily have told him a floor too high or too
low, and that would, at least, have caused delay.
But after all, a man must prove himself a man and
the least you can do is to meet Fate with an unflinching
eye and give the right floor number.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Too often has the scene in the dentist&#39;s waiting-room
been described for me to try to do it again
here. They are all alike. The antiseptic smell,
the ominous hum from the operating-rooms, the 1921
"Literary Digests," and the silent, sullen, group
of waiting patients, each trying to look unconcerned
and cordially disliking everyone else in the room,—all
these have been sung by poets of far greater
lyric powers than mine. (Not that I really think
that they <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">are</span> greater than mine, but that&#39;s the customary
form of excuse for not writing something
you haven&#39;t got time or space to do. As a matter
of fact, I think I could do it much better than it
has ever been done before).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I can only say that, as you sit looking, with
unseeing eyes, through a large book entitled, "The
Great War in Pictures," you would gladly change
places with the most lowly of God&#39;s creatures. It
is inconceivable that there should be anyone worse
off than you, unless perhaps it is some of the poor
wretches who are waiting with you.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That one over in the arm-chair, nervously tearing
<span class="tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to shreds a copy of "The Dental Review and Practical Inlay
Worker." She may have something frightful the trouble with
her. She couldn&#39;t possibly look more worried. Perhaps it
is very, very painful. This thought cheers you up considerably.
What cowards women are in times like these!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And then there comes the sound of voices from the next room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"All right, Doctor, and if it gives me any more pain shall
I call you up?... Do you think that it will bleed much more?...
Saturday morning, then, at eleven.... Good bye, Doctor."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And a middle-aged woman emerges (all women
are middle-aged when emerging from the dentist&#39;s
office) looking as if she were playing the big emotional scene
in "John Ferguson." A wisp of hair
waves dissolutely across her forehead between her
eyes. Her face is pale, except for a slight inflammation
at the corners of her mouth, and in her eyes
is that far-away look of one who has been face to
face with Life. But she is through. She should
care how she looks.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image10" id="image10" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image10.png" alt="You would gladly change places with the most lawless of God&#39;s creatures." class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">You would gladly change places with the
most lawless of God&#39;s creatures.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The nurse appears, and looks inquiringly at each
one in the room. Each one in the room evades the
nurse&#39;s glance in one last, futile attempt to fool
someone and get away without seeing the dentist.
But she spots you and nods pleasantly. God, how
<span class="tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pleasantly she nods! There ought to be a law against
people being as pleasant as that.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The doctor will see you now," she says.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The English language may hold a more disagreeable combination
of words than "The doctor will see you now." I am willing
to concede something to the phrase "Have you anything to say
before the current is turned on." That may be worse for the
moment, but it doesn&#39;t last so long. For continued, unmitigating
depression, I know nothing to equal "The doctor will see you
now." But I&#39;m not narrow-minded about it. I&#39;m willing to
consider other possibilities.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Smiling feebly, you trip over the extended feet of the
man next to you, and stagger into the delivery-room, where,
amid a ghastly array of death-masks of teeth, blue flames
waving eerily from Bunsen burners, and the drowning sound of
perpetually running water which chokes and gurgles at intervals,
you sink into the chair and close your eyes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But now let us consider the spiritual exaltation
that comes when you are at last let down and turned
loose. It is all over, and what did it amount to?
Why, nothing at all. A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Nothing
at all.<span class="tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">You suddenly develop a particular friendship for
the dentist. A splendid fellow, really. You ask
him questions about his instruments. What does
he use this thing for, for instance? Well, well, to
think, of a little thing like that making all that
trouble. A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!... And the dentist&#39;s
family, how are they? Isn&#39;t that fine!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gaily you shake hands with him and straighten
your tie. Forgotten is the fact that you have another
appointment with him for Monday. There
is no such thing as Monday. You are through for
today, and all&#39;s right with the world.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As you pass out through the waiting-room, you
leer at the others unpleasantly. The poor fishes!
Why can&#39;t they take their medicine like grown
people and not sit there moping as if they were
going to be shot?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Heigh-ho! Here&#39;s the elevator-man! A charming
fellow! You wonder if he knows that you have
just had a tooth filled. You feel tempted to tell
him and slap him on the back. You feel tempted
to tell everyone out in the bright, cheery street.
And what a wonderful street it is too! All full of
nice, black snow and water. After all, Life is sweet!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And then you go and find the first person whom
you can accost without being arrested and explain
to him just what it was that the dentist did to you,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and how you felt, and what you have got to have
done next time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Which brings us right back to where we were
in the beginning, and perhaps accounts for everyone&#39;s
liking to divulge their dental secrets to others.
It may be a sort of hysterical relief that, for the
time being, it is all over with.<span class="tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXVIII—MALIGNANT MIRRORS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">As a rule, I try not to look into mirrors any
more than is absolutely necessary. Things
are depressing enough as they are without my going
out of my way to make myself miserable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But every once in a while it is unavoidable.
There are certain mirrors in town with which I
am brought face to face on occasion and there is
nothing to do but make the best of it. I have
come to classify them according to the harshness
with which they fling the truth into my face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I am unquestionably at my worst in the mirror
before which I try on hats. I may have been going
along all winter thinking of other things, dwelling
on what people tell me is really a splendid spiritual
side to my nature, thinking of myself as rather a
fine sort of person, not dashing perhaps, but one
from whose countenance shines a great light of
honesty and courage which is even more to be
desired than physical beauty. I rather imagine that
little children on the street and grizzled Supreme
<span class="tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Court justices out for a walk turn as I pass and
say "A fine face. Plain, but fine."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then I go in to buy a hat. The mirror in the hat store is
triplicate, so that you see yourself not only head-on but
from each side. The appearance
that I present to myself in this mirror is that of
three police-department photographs showing all
possible approaches to the face of Harry DuChamps,
alias Harry Duval, alias Harry Duffy, wanted in
Rochester for the murder of Nettie Lubitch, age 5.
All that is missing is the longitudinal scar across
the right cheek.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I have never seen a meaner face than mine is in
the hat-store mirror. I could stand its not being
handsome. I could even stand looking weak in an
attractive, man-about-town sort of way. But in
the right hand mirror there confronts me a hang-dog
face, the face of a yellow craven, while at the
left leers an even more repulsive type, sensual and
cruel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Furthermore, even though I have had a hair-cut
that very day, there is an unkempt fringe showing
over my collar in back and the collar itself, (a
Wimpet, 14-1/2, which looked so well on the young
man in the car-card) seems to be something that
would be worn by a Maine guide when he goes into
Portland for the day. My suit needs pressing and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>there is a general air of its having been given to
me, with ten dollars, by the State on my departure
from Sing Sing the day before.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But for an unfavorable full-length view, nothing
can compare with the one that I get of myself as
I pass the shoe-store on the corner. They have a
mirror in the window, so set that it catches the reflection
of people as they step up on the curb. When
there are other forms in the picture it is not always
easy to identify yourself at first, especially at a
distance, and every morning on my way to work,
unless I deliberately avert my face, I am mortified
to discover that the unpleasant-looking man, with
the rather effeminate, swinging gait, whom I see
mincing along through the crowd, is none other than
myself.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image11" id="image11" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">I am mortified to discover that the
unpleasant looking man is none other than myself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The only good mirror in the list is the one in the
elevator of my clothing-store. There is a subdued
light in the car, a sort of golden glow which softens
and idealizes, and the mirror shows only a two-thirds
length, making it impossible to see how badly the
cuffs on my trousers bag over the tops of my shoes.
Here I become myself again. I have even thought
that I might be handsome if I paid as much attention
to my looks as some men do. In this mirror, my
clothes look (for the last time) as similar clothes
look on well-dressed men. A hat which is in every
<span class="tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>respect perfect when seen here, immediately becomes
a senatorial sombrero when I step out into the street,
but for the brief space of time while I am in that elevator,
I am the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">distingué</span>, clean-cut, splendid figure of
a man that the original blue-prints called for. I wonder
if it takes much experience to run an elevator, for if
it doesn&#39;t, I would like to make my life-work running
that car with the magic mirror.<span class="tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXIX—THE POWER OF THE PRESS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Police Commissioner of New York City
explains the wave of crime in that city by
blaming the newspapers. The newspapers, he says,
are constantly printing accounts of robberies and
murders, and these accounts simply encourage other
criminals to come to New York and do the same.
If the papers would stop giving all this publicity to
crime, the crooks might forget that there was such
a thing. As it is, they read about it in their newspapers
every morning, and sooner or later have to
go out and try it for themselves.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This is a terrible thought, but suggests a convenient
alibi for other errant citizens. Thus we
may read the following NEWS NOTES:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Benjamin W. Gleam, age forty-two, of 1946
Ruby Avenue, The Bronx, was arrested last night
for appearing in the Late Byzantine Room of the
Museum of Fine Arts clad only in a suit of medium-weight
underwear. When questioned Gleam said
that he had seen so many pictures in the newspaper
advertisements of respectable men and women going
<span class="tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>about in their underwear, drinking tea, jumping hurdles and holding family
reunions, that he simply
couldn&#39;t stand it any longer, and had to try it for
himself. "The newspapers did it," he is quoted as
saying.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Leonia M. Eggcup, who was arrested yesterday on the charge of bigamy,
issued a statement today through her attorneys, Wine, Women and Song.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am charged with having eleven husbands, all living
in various parts of the
United States," reads
the statement. "This charge is correct. But before
I pay the extreme penalty, I want to have the
public understand that I am not to blame. It is
the fault of the press of this country. Day after
day I read the list of marriages in my morning
paper. Day after day I saw people after people
getting married. Finally the thing got into my
blood, and although I was married at the time, I
felt that I simply had to be married again. Then,
no sooner would I become settled in my new home,
than the constant incitement to further matrimonial
ventures would come through the columns of the
daily press. I fell, it is true, but if there is any
justice in this land, it will be the newspapers and
not I who will suffer."<span class="tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXX—HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">As a pretty tribute to that element of our population which
is under twenty-two years of age, these are called "the Holidays."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This is the only chance that the janitors of the schools
and colleges have to
soak the floors of the
recitation halls with oil to catch the dust of the next
semester, and while this is being done there is nothing
to do with the students but to send them home
for a week or two. Thus it happened that the
term "holidays" is applied to that period of the
year when everybody else is working just twice as
hard and twice as long during the week to make up
for that precious day which must be lost to the Sales
Campaign or the Record Output on Christmas Day.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For those who are home from school and college it is called, in the
catalogues of their institutions,
a "recess" or "vacation," and the general impression
is allowed to get abroad among the parents
that it is to be a period of rest and recuperation.
Arthur and Alice have been working so hard at
school or college that two weeks of good quiet home-life
<span class="tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and home cooking will put them right on their
feet again, ready to pitch into that chemistry course
in which, owing to an incompetent instructor, they
did not do very well last term.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That the theory of rest during vacation is fallacious
can be proved by hiding in the coat closet of
the home of any college or school youth home for
Christmas recess. Admission to the coat closet may
be forced by making yourself out to be a government
official or an inspector of gas meters. Once
hidden among the overshoes, you will overhear the
following little earnest drama, entitled "Home for
the Holidays."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was a banging of the front door, and Edgar
has arrived. A round of kisses, an exchange of
health reports, and Edgar is bounding upstairs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Dinner in half an hour," says Mother.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sorry," shouts Edgar from the bath-tub, "but
I&#39;ve got to go out to the Whortleberry&#39;s to a dinner
dance. Got the bid last week. Say, have I got any
dress-studs at home here? Mine are in my trunk."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Father&#39;s studs are requisitioned and the family
cluster at Edgar&#39;s door to slide in a few conversational
phrases while he is getting the best of his
dress shirt.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How have you been?" (Three guesses as to
who it is that asks this.)<span class="tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, all right. Say, have I got any pumps at home? Mine are
in the trunk. Where are those
old ones I had last summer?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t you want me to tie your tie for you?" (Two guesses as to who it is
that asks this.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, thanks. Can I get my laundry done by tomorrow night?
I&#39;ve got to go out to the Clamps&#39;
at Short Neck for over the week-end to a bob-sledding
party, and when I get back from there
Mrs. Dibble is giving a dinner and theatre party."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t you want to eat a little dinner here
before you go to the Whortleberry&#39;s?" (One guess
as to who it is that asks this.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Edgar has bounded down the stairs and left
the Family to comfort each other with such observations
as "He looks tired," "I think that he has
filled out a little," or "I wonder if he&#39;s studying
too hard."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">You might stay in the coat-closet for the entire
two weeks and not hear much more of Edgar than
this. His parents don&#39;t. They catch him as he is
going up and down stairs and while he is putting
the studs into his shirt, and are thankful for that.
They really get into closer touch with him while
he is at college, for he writes them a weekly letter
then.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Nerve-racking as this sort of life is to the youth
<span class="tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>who is supposed to be resting during his vacation,
it might be even more wearing if he were to stay
within the Family precincts. Once in a while one
of the parties for which he has been signed up falls
through, and he is forced to spend the evening at
home. At first it is somewhat embarrassing to be
thrown in with strangers for a meal like that, but,
as the evening wears on, the ice is broken and
things assume a more easy swing. The Family begins
to make remarks.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You must stand up straighter, my boy," says
Father, placing his hand between Edgar&#39;s shoulder-blades.
"You are slouching badly. I noticed it as
you walked down the street this morning."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do all the boys wear soft-collared shirts like
that?" asks Mother. "Personally, I think that they
look very untidy. They are all right for tennis
and things like that, but I wish you&#39;d put on a
starched collar when you are in the house. You
never see Elmer Quiggly wearing a collar like that.
He always looks neat."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"For heaven&#39;s sake, Eddie," says Sister, "take
off that tie. You certainly do get the most terrific-looking
things to put around your neck. It looks
like a Masonic apron. Let me go with you when
you buy your next batch."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">By this time Edgar has his back against the wall
<span class="tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and is breathing hard. What do these folks know
of what is being done?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If it is not family heckling it may be that even
more insidious trial, the third degree. This is usually
inflicted by semi-relatives and neighbors. The
formulæ are something like this:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, how do you like your school?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I suppose you have plenty of time for pranks,
eh?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What a good time you boys must have! It isn&#39;t
so much what you get out of books that will help
you in after life, I have found, but the friendships
made in college. Meeting so many boys from all
parts of the country—why, it&#39;s a liberal education
in itself."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What was the matter with the football team
this season?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Let&#39;s see, how many more years have you?
What, only one more! Well, well, and I can remember
you when you were that high, and used to
come over to my house wearing a little green dress,
with big mother-of-pearl buttons. You certainly
were a cute little boy, and used to call our cook
&#39;Sna-sna.&#39; And here you are, almost a senior."</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image12" id="image12" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image12.png" alt="&quot;I can remember you when you were that high.&quot;" class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">"I can remember you when you were that high."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, are you 1924? I wonder if you know a
fellow named—er—Mellish—Spencer Mellish?
I met him at the beach last summer. I am pretty
<span class="tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sure that he is in your class—well, no, maybe it
was 1918."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After an hour or two of this Edgar is willing to
go back to college and take an extra course in Blacksmithing, Chipping and
Filing, given during the
Christmas vacation, rather than run the risk of getting
caught again. And, whichever way you look
at it, whether he spends his time getting into and
out of his evening clothes, or goes crazy answering
questions and defending his mode of dress, it all
adds up to the same in the end—fatigue and depletion
and what the doctor would call "a general
run-down nervous condition."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The younger you are the more frayed you get.
Little Wilbur comes home from school, where he
has been put to bed at 8:30 every night with the
rest of the fifth form boys: and has had to brush
his hair in the presence of the head-master&#39;s wife,
and dives into what might be called a veritable
maelstrom of activity. From a diet of cereal and
fruit-whips, he is turned loose in the butler&#39;s pantry
among the maraschino cherries and given a free rein
at the various children&#39;s parties, where individual
pound-cake Santas and brandied walnuts are followed
by an afternoon at "Treasure Island," with
the result that he comes home and insists on tipping
<span class="tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>every one in the family the black spot and breaks
the cheval glass when he is denied going to the six-day
bicycle race at two in the morning.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Little girls do practically the same, and, if they
are over fourteen, go back to school with the added
burden of an <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">affaire de coeur</span> contracted during the
recess. In general, it takes about a month or two
of good, hard schooling and overstudy to put the
child back on its feet after the Christmas rest at
home.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Which leads us to the conclusion that our educational
system is all wrong. It is obvious that the
child should be kept at home for eight months out
of the year and sent to school for the vacations.<span class="tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXXI—HOW TO UNDERSTAND INTERNATIONAL FINANCE</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is high time that someone came out with a
clear statement of the international financial
situation. For weeks and weeks officials have been
rushing about holding conferences and councils and
having their pictures taken going up and down the
steps of buildings. Then, after each conference,
the newspapers have printed a lot of figures showing
the latest returns on how much Germany owes
the bank. And none of it means anything.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now there is a certain principle which has to
be followed in all financial discussions involving
sums over one hundred dollars. There is probably
not more than one hundred dollars in actual cash in
circulation today. That is, if you were to call in
all the bills and silver and gold in the country at
noon tomorrow and pile them up on the table, you
would find that you had just about one hundred
dollars, with perhaps several Canadian pennies and
a few peppermint life-savers. All the rest of the
money you hear about doesn&#39;t exist. It is conversation-money.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>When you hear of a transaction
involving $50,000,000 it means that one firm wrote
"50,000,000" on a piece of paper and gave it to
another firm, and the other firm took it home and
said "Look, Momma, I got $50,000,000!" But
when Momma asked for a dollar and a quarter out
of it to pay the man who washed the windows, the
answer probably was that the firm hadn&#39;t got more
than seventy cents in cash.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This is the principle of finance. So long as you
can pronounce any number above a thousand, you
have got that much money. You can&#39;t work this
scheme with the shoe-store man or the restaurant-owner,
but it goes big on Wall St. or in international
financial circles.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This much understood, we see that when the
Allies demand 132,000,000,000 gold marks from
Germany they know very well that nobody in Germany
has ever seen 132,000,000,000 gold marks
and never will. A more surprised and disappointed
lot of boys you couldn&#39;t ask to see than the Supreme
Financial Council would be if Germany were actually
to send them a money-order for the full amount
demanded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What they mean is that, taken all in all, Germany
owes the world 132,000,000,000 gold marks plus
carfare. This includes everything, breakage, meals
<span class="tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sent to room, good will, everything. Now, it is
understood that if they really meant this, Germany
couldn&#39;t even draw cards; so the principle on which
the thing is figured out is as follows: (Watch this
closely; there is a trick in it).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">You put down a lot of figures, like this. Any
figures will do, so long as you can&#39;t read them
quickly:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">132,000,000,000 gold marks</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">$33,000,000,000 on a current value basis</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">$21,000,000,000 on reparation account plus 12-1/2%
yearly tax on German exports</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">11,000,000,000 gold fish</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">$1.35 amusement tax</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">866,000 miles. Diameter of the sun</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">2,000,000,000</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">27,000,000,000</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">31,000,000,000</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then you add them together and subtract the
number you first thought of. This leaves 11. And
the card you hold in your hand is the seven of
diamonds. Am I right?<span class="tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">(<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">An Imaginary Watch-Night with the Weather Man</span>)</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was 11 o&#39;clock on the night of June 20. We
were seated in the office of the Weather Bureau
on the twenty-ninth floor of the Whitehall Building,
the Weather Man and I, and we were waiting
for summer to come. It was officially due on
June 21. We had the almanac&#39;s word for it and
years and years of precedent, but still the Weather
Man was skeptical.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It had been a hard spring for the Weather Man.
Day after day he had been forced to run a signed
statement in the daily papers to the effect that some
time during that day there would probably be
showers. And day after day, with a ghastly
consistency, his prophecy had come true. People had
come to dislike him personally; old jokes about
him were brought out and oiled and given a trial
spin down the road a piece before appearing in
funny columns and vaudeville skits, and the sporting
<span class="tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>writers, frenzied by the task of filling their
space with nothing but tables of batting averages,
had become positively libellous.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And now summer was at hand, and with it the
promise of the sun. The Weather Man nibbled
at his thumb nail. The clock on the wall said
11:15.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It just couldn&#39;t go back on us now," he said,
plaintively, "when it means so much to us. It
always <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">has</span> come on the 21st."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was not much that I could say. I didn&#39;t
want to hold out any false hope, for I am a child
in arms in matters of astronomy, or whatever it is
that makes weather.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I often remember hearing my father tell," I
ventured, "how every year on the 21st of June
summer always used to come, rain or shine, until
they came to look for it on that date, and to count
from then as the beginning of the season. It seems
as if"—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I know," he interrupted, "but there have been
so many upsetting things during the past twelve
months. We can&#39;t check up this year by any other
years. All we can do is wait and see."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A gust of wind from Jersey ran along the side
of the building, shaking at the windows. The
Weather Man shuddered, and looked out of the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>corner of his eye at the anemometer-register which
stood on a table in the middle of the room. It
indicated whatever anemometers do indicate when
they want to register bad news. I considerately
looked out at the window.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You&#39;ve no idea," he said at last, in a low voice,
"of how this last rainy spell has affected my home
life. For the first two or three days, although I
got dark looks from slight acquaintances, there
was always a cheery welcome waiting for me when
I got home, and the Little Woman would say,
&#39;Never mind, Ray, it will soon be pleasant, and
we all know that it&#39;s not your fault, anyway.&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But then, after a week had passed and there
had been nothing but rain and showers and rain,
I began to notice a change. When I would swing
in at the gate she would meet me and say, in a
far-away voice, &#39;Well, what is it for to-morrow?&#39;
And I would have to say &#39;Probably cloudy, with
occasional showers and light easterly gales.&#39; At
which she would turn away and bite her lip, and
once I thought I saw her eye-lashes wet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then, one night, the break came. It had
started out to be a perfect day, just such as one
reads about, but along about noon it began to cloud
over and soon the rain poured down in rain-gauges-full.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image13" id="image13" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image13.png" alt="She would turn away and bite her lip." class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">She would turn away and bite her lip.<span class="tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I was all discouraged, and as I wrote out the
forecast for the papers, &#39;Rain to-morrow and
Friday,&#39; I felt like giving the whole thing up and
going back to Vermont to live.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"When I got home, Alice was there with her
things on, waiting for me.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;You needn&#39;t tell me what it&#39;s going to be
to-morrow,&#39; she sobbed. &#39;I know. Every one
knows. The whole world knows. I used to think
that it wasn&#39;t your fault, but when the children
come home from school crying because they have
been plagued for being the Weather Man&#39;s children,
when every time I go out I know that the
neighbors are talking behind my back and saying
"How does she stand it?" when every paper I
read, every bulletin I see, stares me in the face
with great letters saying, "Weather Man predicts
more rain," or "Lynch the Weather Man and let
the baseball season go on," then I think it is time
for us to come to an understanding. I am going
over to mother&#39;s until you can do better.&#39;"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Weather Man got up and went to the window.
Out there over the Battery there was a spot
casting a sickly glow through the cloud-banks
which filled the sky.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s the moon up there behind the fog," he
said, and laughed a bitter cackle.<span class="tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was now 11:45. The thermograph was writing
busily in red ink on the little diagrammed cuff
provided for that purpose, writing all about the
temperature. The Weather Man inspected the fine,
jagged line as it leaked out of the pen on the chart.
Then he walked over to the window again and
stood looking out over the bay.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You&#39;d think that people would have a little
gratitude," he said in a low voice, "and not hit at
a man who has done so much for them. If it
weren&#39;t for me where would the art of American
conversation be to-day? If there were no weather
to talk about, how could there be any dinner parties
or church sociables or sidewalk chats?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"All I have to do is put out a real scorcher or
a continued cold snap, and I can drive off the
boards the biggest news story that was ever launched
or draw the teeth out of the most delicate international
situation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I have saved more reputations and social
functions than any other influence in American
life, and yet here, when the home office sends me a
rummy lot of weather, over which I have no control,
everybody jumps on me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He pulled savagely at the window shade and
pressed his nose against the pane in silence for a
while.<span class="tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was no sound but the ticking of the
anemometer and the steady scratching of the thermograph.
I looked at the clock. 11:47.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly the telegraph over in the corner
snapped like a bunch of firecrackers. In a second
the Weather Man was at its side, taking down the
message:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">NEW ORLEANS, LA NHRUFKYOTLDMRELPWZWOTUDK
HEAVY PRECIPITATION
SOUTH WESTERLY GALES LETTER FOLLOWS</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">NEW ORLEANS U S WEATHER BUREAU</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Poor fellow," muttered the Weather Man, who
even in his own tense excitement did not forget the
troubles of his brother weather prophet in New
Orleans, "I know just how he feels. I hope he&#39;s
not married."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He glanced at the clock. It was 11:56. In four
minutes summer would be due, and with summer
a clearer sky, renewed friendships and a united
family for the Weather Man. If it failed him—I
dreaded to think of what might happen. It was
twenty-nine floors to the pavement below, and I
am not a powerful man physically.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Together we sat at the table by the thermograph
and watched the red line draw mountain ranges
<span class="tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>along the 50 degree line. From our seats we could
look out over the Statue of Liberty and see the
cloud-dimmed glow which told of a censored moon.
The Weather Man was making nervous little pokes
at his collar, as if it had a rough edge that was
cutting his neck.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly he gripped the table. Somewhere a
clock was beginning to strike twelve. I shut my
eyes and waited.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Ten-eleven-twelve!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Look, Newspaper Man, look!" he shrieked and
grabbed me by the tie.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I opened my eyes and looked at the thermograph.
At the last stroke of the clock the red line had given
a little, final quaver on the 50 degree line and then
had shot up like a rocket until it struck 72 degrees
and lay there trembling and heaving like a runner
after a race.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But it was not at this that the Weather Man
was pointing. There, out in the murky sky, the
stroke of twelve had ripped apart the clouds and
a large, milk-fed moon was fairly crashing its way
through, laying out a straight-away course of silver
cinders across the harbor, and in all parts of the
heavens stars were breaking out like a rash. In
two minutes it had become a balmy, languorous
night. Summer had come!<span class="tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I turned to the Weather Man. He was wiping
the palms of his hands on his hips and looking
foolishly happy. I said nothing. There was
nothing that could be said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Before we left the office he stopped to write out
the prophecy for Wednesday, June 21, the First Day
of Summer. "Fair and warmer, with slowly rising
temperatur." His hand trembled so as he wrote
that he forgot the final "e". Then we went out and
he turned toward his home.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On Wednesday, June 21, it rained.<span class="tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXXIII—WELCOME HOME—AND SHUT UP!</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">
There are a few weeks which bid fair to be
pretty trying ones in our national life. They
will mark the return to the city of thousands and
thousands of vacationists after two months or two
weeks of feverish recuperation and there is probably
no more obnoxious class of citizen, taken end for
end, than the returning vacationist.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the first place, they are all so offensively
healthy. They come crashing through the train-shed,
all brown and peeling, as if their health were
something they had acquired through some particular
credit to themselves. If it were possible, some
of them would wear their sun-burned noses on their
watch-chains, like Phi Beta Kappa keys.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They have got so used to going about all summer
in bathing suits and shirts open at the neck that
they look like professional wrestlers in stiff collars
and seem to be on the point of bursting out at any
minute. And they always make a great deal of
noise getting off the train.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Where&#39;s Bessie?" they scream, "Ned, where&#39;s
<span class="tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Bessie?... Have you got the thermos bottles?...
Well, here&#39;s the old station just as it was when
we left it (hysterical laughter).... Wallace, you
simply must carry your pail and shovel. Mamma
can&#39;t carry <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">everything</span>, you know.... Mamma
told you that if you wanted to bring your pail and
shovel home you would have to carry it yourself,
don&#39;t you remember Mamma told you that, Wallace?...
Wallace, listen!... Edna, have you
got Bessie?... Harry&#39;s gone after the trunks....
At least, he <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">said</span> that was where he was going....
Look, there&#39;s the Dexter Building, looking
just the same. Big as life and twice as natural....
I know, Wallace, Mamma&#39;s just as hot as you are.
But you don&#39;t hear Mamma crying do you?... I
wonder where Bert is.... He said he&#39;d be down
to meet us sure.... Here, give me that cape, Lillian....
You&#39;re dragging it all over the ground....
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Here&#39;s Bert!... Whoo-hoo, Bert</span>!...
Here we are!... Spencer, there&#39;s Daddy!...
Whoo-hoo, Daddy!... Junior, wipe that gum off
your shoe this minute.... <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Where&#39;s Bessie</span>?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And so they go, all the way out into the street
and the cab and home, millions of them. It&#39;s
terrible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And when they get home things are just about as
bad, except there aren&#39;t so many people to see them.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>At the sight of eight Sunday and sixty-two daily papers
strewn over the front porch and lawn, there are
loud screams of imprecation at Daddy for having
forgotten to order them stopped. Daddy insists
that he did order them stopped and that it is that
damn fool boy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I guess you weren&#39;t home much during July,"
says Mamma bitterly, "or you would have noticed
that something was wrong." (Daddy didn&#39;t join
the family until August.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There were no papers delivered during
July," says Daddy very firmly and quietly,
"at least, I didn&#39;t see any." (Stepping on one
dated July 19.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The inside of the house resembles some place
you might bet a man a hundred dollars he daren&#39;t
spend the night in. Dead men&#39;s feet seem to be
protruding from behind sofas and there is a damp
smell as if the rooms had been closed pending the
arrival of the coroner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Junior runs upstairs to see if his switching engine
is where he left it and comes falling down stairs
panting with terror announcing that there is Something
in the guest-room. At that moment there is
a sound of someone leaving the house by the back
door. Daddy is elected by popular vote to go upstairs
and see what has happened, although he insists
<span class="tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that he has to wait down stairs as the man with
the trunks will be there at any minute. After five
minutes of cagey manoeuvering around in the hall
outside the guest-room door, he returns looking for
Junior, saying that it was simply a pile of things
left on the bed covered with a sheet. "Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then comes the unpacking. It has been estimated
that in the trunks of returning vacationists,
taking this section of the country as a whole, the
following articles will be pulled out during the next few weeks:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sneakers, full of sand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Bathing suits, still damp from the "one last
swim."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dead tennis balls.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Last month&#39;s magazines, bought for reading in the
grove.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Shells and pretty stones picked up on the beach
for decoration purposes, for which there has suddenly
become no use at all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Horse-shoe crabs, salvaged by children who refused
to leave them behind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Lace scarfs and shawls, bought from itinerant
Armenians.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Remnants of tubes formerly containing sunburn
<span class="tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ointment, half-filled bottles of citronella and white
shoe-dressing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">White flannel trousers, ready for the cleaners.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Snap-shots, showing Ed and Mollie on the beach
in their bathing suits.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Snap-shots which show nothing at all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Faded flowers, dance-cards and assorted sentimental
objects, calculated to bring up tender memories
of summer evenings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Uncompleted knit-sweaters.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then begins the tour of the neighborhood, comparing
summer-vacation experiences. To each returning
vacationist it seems as if everyone in town
must be interested in what he or she did during the
summer. They stop perfect strangers on the streets
and say: "Well, a week ago today at this time we
were all walking up to the Post-Office for the mail.
Right out in front of the Post-Office were the fish-houses
and you ought to have seen Billy one night
leading a lobster home on a string. That was the
night we all went swimming by moon-light."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yeah?" says the stranger, and pushes his way
past.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then two people get together who have been to
different places. Neither wants to hear about the
other&#39;s summer—and neither does. Both talk at
<span class="tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>once and pull snap-shots out of their pockets.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Here&#39;s where we used to take our lunch—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s nothing. Steve had a friend up the lake
who had a launch—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"—and everyday there was something doing over
at the Casino—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"—and you ought to have seen Miriam, she was
a sight—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Pretty soon they come to blows trying to make
each other listen. The only trouble is they never
quite kill each other. If only one could be killed
it would be a great help.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next ban on immigration should be on returning
vacationists. Have government officials
stationed in each city and keep everyone out who
won&#39;t give a bond to shut up and go right to work.<span class="tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">How Georgie Dog Gets the Rubbers on the Guest Room Bed</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Old Mother Nature gathered all her little
pupils about her for the daily lesson in "How
the Animals Do the Things They Do." Every day
Waldo Lizard, Edna Elephant and Lawrence
Walrus came to Mother Nature&#39;s school, and there
learned all about the useless feats performed by
their brother and sister animals.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Today," said Mother Nature, "we shall find
out how it is that Georgie Dog manages to get the
muddy rubbers from the hall closet, up the stairs,
and onto the nice white bedspread in the guest
room. You must be sure to listen carefully and
pay strict attention to what Georgie Dog says.
Only, don&#39;t take too much of it seriously, for
Georgie is an awful liar."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And, sure enough, in came Georgie Dog, wagging
his entire torso in a paroxysm of camaradarie, although
<span class="tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>everyone knew that he had no use for Waldo
Lizard.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tell us, Georgie," said Mother Nature, "how
do you do your clever work of rubber-dragging?
We would like so much to know. Wouldn&#39;t we,
children?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, Mother Nature!" came the instant response
from the children.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">So Georgie Dog began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I&#39;ll tell you; it&#39;s this way," he said, snapping
at a fly. "You have to be very niftig about
it. First of all, I lie by the door of the hall closet
until I see a nice pair of muddy rubbers kicked
into it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How muddy ought they to be?" asked Edna
Elephant, although little enough use she would have
for the information.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am glad that you asked that question," replied
Georgie. "Personally; I like to have mud on
them about the consistency of gurry—that is, not
too wet—because then it will all drip off on the
way upstairs, and not so dry that it scrapes off on
the carpet. For we must save it all for the bedspread,
you know.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"As soon as the rubbers are safely in the hall
closet, I make a great deal of todo about going
into the other room, in order to give the impression
<span class="tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that there is nothing interesting enough in the hall
to keep me there. A good, loud yawn helps to
disarm any suspicion of undue excitement. I sometimes
even chew a bit of fringe on the sofa and take
a scolding for it—anything to draw attention from
the rubbers. Then, when everyone is at dinner, I
sneak out and drag them forth."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And how do you manage to take them both at
once?" piped up Lawrence Walrus.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am glad that you asked that question," said
Georgie, "because I was trying to avoid it. You
can never guess what the answer is. It is very
difficult to take two at a time, and so we usually
have to take one and then go back and get the
other. I had a cousin once who knew a grip which
could be worked on the backs of overshoes, by
means of which he could drag two at a time, but
he was an exceptionally fine dragger. He once
took a pair of rubber boots from the barn into the
front room, where a wedding was taking place, and
put them on the bride&#39;s train. Of course, not one
dog in a million could hope to do that.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Once upstairs, it is quite easy getting them into
the guest room, unless the door happens to be shut.
Then what do you think I do? I go around
through the bath-room window onto the roof, and
walk around to the sleeping porch, and climb down
<span class="tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>into the guest room that way. It is a lot of trouble,
but I think that you will agree with me that the
results are worth it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Climbing up on the bed with the rubbers in
my mouth is difficult, but it doesn&#39;t make any difference
if some of the mud comes off on the side
of the bedspread. In fact, it all helps in the final
effect. I usually try to smear them around when
I get them at last on the spread, and if I can leave
one of them on the pillow, I feel that it&#39;s a pretty
fine little old world, after all. This done, and I
am off."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And Georgie Dog suddenly disappeared in official
pursuit of an automobile going eighty-five miles an
hour.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"So now," said Mother Nature to her little
pupils, "we have heard all about Georgie Dog&#39;s
work. To-morrow we may listen to Lillian Mosquito
tell how she makes her voice carry across a
room."<span class="tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">How Lillian Mosquito Projects Her Voice</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">All the children came crowding around Mother
Nature one cold, raw afternoon in summer,
crying in unison:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, Mother Nature, you promised us that you
would tell us how Lillian Mosquito projects her
voice! You promised that you would tell us how
Lillian Mosquito projects her voice!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"So I did! So I did!" said Mother Nature,
laying down an oak, the leaves of which she was
tipping with scarlet for the fall trade. "And so I
will! So I will!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At which Waldo Lizard, Edna Elephant and
Lawrence Walrus jumped with imitation joy, for
they had hoped to have an afternoon off.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mother Nature led them across the fields to the
piazza of a clubhouse on which there was an exposed
ankle belonging to one of the members.
There, as she had expected, they found Lillian Mosquito
having tea.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Lillian," called Mother Nature, "come off a
minute. I have some little friends here who would
like to know how it is that you manage to hum in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>such a manner as to give the impression of being
just outside the ear of a person in bed, when
actually you are across the room."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Will you kindly repeat the question?" said
Lillian flying over to the railing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"We want to know," said Mother Nature, "how
it is that very often, when you have been fairly
caught, it turns out that you have escaped without
injury."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I would prefer to answer the question as it
was first put," said Lillian.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">So Waldo Lizard, Edna Elephant and Lawrence
Walrus, seeing that there was no way out, cried:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, yes, Lillian, do tell us."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"First of all, you must know," began Lillian
Mosquito, "that my chief duty is to annoy. Whatever
else I do, however many bites I total in the
course of the evening, I do not consider that I have
&#39;made good&#39; unless I have caused a great deal of
annoyance while doing it. A bite, quietly executed
and not discovered by the victim until morning,
does me no good. It is my duty, and my pleasure,
to play with him before biting, as you have often
heard a cat plays with a mouse, tormenting him with
apprehension and making him struggle to defend
himself.... If I am using too long words for you,
please stop me."<span class="tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Stop!" cried Waldo Lizard, reaching for his
hat, with the idea of possibly getting to the ball
park by the fifth inning.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But he was prevented from leaving by kindly old
Mother Nature, who stepped on him with her kindly
old heel, and Lillian Mosquito continued:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I must therefore, you see, be able to use my
little voice with great skill. Of course, the first thing
to do is to make my victim think that I am nearer
to him than I really am. To do this, I sit quite
still, let us say, on the footboard of the bed, and,
beginning to hum in a very, very low tone of voice,
increase the volume and raise the pitch gradually,
thereby giving the effect of approaching the pillow.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The man in bed thinks that he hears me coming
toward his head, and I can often see him, waiting
with clenched teeth until he thinks that I am near
enough to swat. Sometimes I strike a quick little
grace-note, as if I were right above him and about
to make a landing. It is great fun at such times
to see him suddenly strike himself over the ear
(they always think that I am right at their ear),
and then feel carefully between his finger tips to
see if he has caught me. Then, too, there is always
the pleasure of thinking that perhaps he has hurt
himself quite badly by the blow. I have often
known victims of mine to deafen themselves permanently
<span class="tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by jarring their eardrums in their wild attempts
to catch me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What fun! What fun!" cried Edna Elephant.
"I must try it myself just as soon as ever I get
home."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is often a good plan to make believe that you
have been caught after one of the swats," continued
Lillian Mosquito, "and to keep quiet for a while.
It makes him cocky. He thinks that he has demonstrated
the superiority of man over the rest of
the animals. Then he rolls over and starts to sleep.
This is the time to begin work on him again. After
he has slapped himself all over the face and head,
and after he has put on the light and made a search
of the room and then gone back to bed to think up
some new words, that is the time when I usually
bring the climax about.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Gradually approaching him from the right, I
hum loudly at his ear. Then, suddenly becoming
quiet, I fly silently and quickly around to his neck.
Just as he hits himself on the ear, I bite his neck
and fly away. And, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">voilà</span>, there you are!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How true that is!" said Mother Nature. "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Voilà</span>,
there we are!... Come, children, let us go now,
for we must be up bright and early to-morrow to
learn how Lois Hen scratches up the beets and Swiss

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXXV—THE TARIFF UNMASKED</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Let us get this tariff thing cleared up, once
and for all. An explanation is due the American
people, and obviously this is the place to make
it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Viewing the whole thing, schedule by schedule,
we find it indefensible. In Schedule A alone the
list of necessities on which the tax is to be raised
includes Persian berries, extract of nutgalls and
isinglass. Take isinglass alone. With prices shooting
up in this market, what is to become of our
picture post-cards? Where once for a nickel you
could get a picture of the Woolworth Building
ablaze with lights with the sun setting and the
moon rising in the background, under the proposed
tariff it will easily set you back fifteen cents. This
is all very well for the rich who can get their picture
post-cards at wholesale, but how are the poor to get
their art?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The only justifiable increase in this schedule
is on "blues, in pulp, dried, etc." If this
will serve to reduce the amount of "Those
<span class="tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Lonesome-Onesome-Wonesome Blues" and "I&#39;ve
Got the Left-All-Alone-in-The-Magazine-Reading-Room-of-the-Public-Library
Blues" with which our
popular song market has been flooded for the past
five years, we could almost bring ourselves to vote
for the entire tariff bill as it stands.</p>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<h2 class="tei tei-head"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Schedule B</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">Here we find a tremendous increase in the tax
on grindstones. Householders and travelers in general
do not appreciate what this means. It means
that, next year, when you are returning from Europe,
you will have to pay a duty on those Dutch grindstones
that you always bring back to the cousins, a
duty which will make the importation of more
than three prohibitive. This will lead to an orgy of
grindstone smuggling, making it necessary for hitherto
respectable people to become law-breakers by
concealing grindstones about their clothing and in
the trays of their trunks. Think this over.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<h2 class="tei tei-head"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Schedule C</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">Right at the start of this list we find charcoal
bars being boosted. Have our children no rights?
What is a train-ride with children without Hershey&#39;s
charcoal bars? Or gypsum? What more picturesque
on a ride through the country-side than a
<span class="tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>band of gypsum encamped by the road with their
bright colors and gay tambourine playing? Are
these simple folk to be kept out of this country
simply because a Republican tariff insists on raising
the tax on gypsum?</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<h2 class="tei tei-head"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Schedule D</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">A way to evade the injustice of this schedule is
in the matter of marble slabs. "Marble slabs,
rubbed" are going to cost more to import than
"marble slabs, unrubbed." What we are planning
to do in this office is to get in a quantity of
unrubbed marble slabs and then rub them ourselves.
A coarse, dry towel is very good for rubbing, they
say.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Any further discussion of the details of this iniquitous
tariff would only enrage us to a point of incoherence.
Perhaps a short list of some of the
things you will have to do without under the new
arrangement will serve to enrage you also:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Senegal gum, buchu leaves, lava tips for burners,
magic lantern strips, spiegeleisen nut washers,
butchers&#39; skewers and gun wads.</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXXVI—"TAKE ALONG A BOOK"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">There seems to be a concerted effort, manifest
in the "Take Along a Book" drive, to
induce vacationists to slip at least one volume into
the trunk before getting Daddy to jump on it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This is a fine idea, for there is always a space between
the end of the tennis-racquet and the box of
soap in which the shoe-whitening is liable to tip
over unless you jam a book in with it. Any book
will do.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is usually a book that you have been meaning
to read all Spring, one that you have got so used to
lying about to people who have asked you if you
have read it that you have almost kidded yourself
into believing that you really have read it. You
picture yourself out in the hammock or down on the
rocks, with a pillow under your head and pipe or
a box of candy near at hand, just devouring page
after page of it. The only thing that worries you
is what you will read when you have finished that.
"Oh, well," you think, "there will probably be
some books in the town library. Maybe I can get
<span class="tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Gibbon there. This summer will be a good time to
read Gibbon through."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Your trunk doesn&#39;t reach the cottage until four
days after you arrive, owing to the ferry-pilots&#39;
strike. You don&#39;t get it unpacked down as far as
the layer in which the book is until you have been
there a week.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then the book is taken out and put on the table.
In transit it has tried to eat its way through a pair
of tramping-boots, with the result that one corner
and the first twenty pages have become dog-eared,
but that won&#39;t interfere with its being read.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Several other things do interfere, however. The
nice weather, for instance. You start out from your
room in the morning and somehow or other never
get back to it except when you are in a hurry to get
ready for meals or for bed. You try to read in bed
one night, but you can&#39;t seem to fix your sun-burned
shoulders in a comfortable position.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">You take the book down to luncheon and leave
it at the table. And you don&#39;t miss it for three
days. When you find it again it has large blisters
on page 35 where some water was dropped on it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then Mrs. Beatty, who lives in Montclair in the
winter time (no matter where you go for the summer,
you always meet some people who live in Montclair
in the winter), borrows the book, as she has
<span class="tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>heard so much about it. Two weeks later she brings
it back, and explains that Prince got hold of it one
afternoon and chewed just a little of the back off,
but says that she doesn&#39;t think it will be noticed
when the book is in the bookcase.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Back to the table in the bedroom it goes and is
used to keep unanswered post-cards in. It also is
convenient as a backing for cards which you yourself
are writing. And the flyleaf makes an excellent
place for a bridge-score if there isn&#39;t any other
paper handy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When it comes time to pack up for home, you
shake the sand from among the leaves and save out
the book to be read on the train. And you leave it
in the automobile that takes you to the station.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But for all that, "take along a book." It might
rain all summer.<span class="tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXXVII—CONFESSIONS OF A CHESS CHAMPION</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">With the opening of the baseball season, the
sporting urge stirs in one&#39;s blood and we
turn to such books as "My Chess Career," by J.R.
Capablanca. Mr. Capablanca, I gather from his
text, plays chess very well. Wherein he unquestionably
has something on me.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His book is a combination of autobiography and
pictorial examples of difficult games he has participated
in and won. I could understand the autobiographical
part perfectly, but although I have seen
chess diagrams in the evening papers for years, I
never have been able to become nervous over one.
It has always seemed to me that when you have
seen one diagram of a chessboard you have seen
them all. Therefore, I can give only a superficial
review of the technical parts of Mr. Capablanca&#39;s
book.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His personal reminiscences, however, are full of
poignant episodes. For instance, let us take an
<span class="tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>incident which occurred in his early boyhood when
he found out what sort of man his father really
was—a sombre event in the life of any boy, much
more so for the boy Capablanca.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I was born in Havana, the capital of the Island
of Cuba," he says, "the 19th of November, 1888.
I was not yet five years old when by accident I
came into my father&#39;s private office and found him
playing with another gentleman. I had never seen
a game of chess before; the pieces interested me
and I went the next day to see them play again.
The third day, as I looked on, my father, a very
poor beginner, moved a Knight from a white square
to another white square. His opponent, apparently
not a better player, did not notice it. My father
won, and I proceeded to call him a cheat and to
laugh."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Imagine the feelings of a young boy entering his
father&#39;s private office and seeing a man whom he
had been brought up to love and to revere moving
a Knight from one white square to another. It is
a wonder that the boy had the courage to grow up
at all with a start in life like that.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But he did grow up, and at the age of eight, in
spite of the advice of doctors, he was a frequent
visitor at the Havana Chess Club. As he says in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>describing this period of his career, "Soon Don
Celso Golmayo, the strongest player there, was unable
to give me a rook." So you can see how good
he was. Don Celso couldn&#39;t give him a rook. And
if Don Celso couldn&#39;t, who on earth could?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In his introduction, Mr. Capablanca (I wish
that I could get it out of my head that Mr. Capablanca
is possibly a relation of the Casablanca boy
who did the right thing by the burning deck. They
are, of course, two entirely different people)—in
his introduction, Mr. Capablanca says:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Conceit I consider a foolish thing; but more
foolish still is that false modesty that vainly attempts
to conceal that which all facts tend to prove."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is this straining to overcome a foolish, false
modesty which leads him to say, in connection with
his matches with members of the Manhattan Chess
Club. "As one by one I mowed them down without
the loss of a single game, my superiority became apparent."
Or, in speaking of his "endings" (a term
we chess experts use to designate the last part of
our game), to murmur modestly: "The endings
I already played very well, and to my mind had
attained the high standard for which they were in
the future to be well known." Mr. Capablanca will
have to watch that false modesty of his. It will get
him into trouble some day.<span class="tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Although this column makes no pretense of carrying
sporting news, it seems only right to print a
part of the running story of the big game between
Capablanca and Dr. O.S. Bernstein in the San Sebastian
tournament of 1911. Capablanca wore the white,
while Dr. Bernstein upheld the honor of the black.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The tense moment of the game had been reached.
Capablanca has the ball on Dr. Bernstein&#39;s 3-yard
line on the second down, with a minute and a half
to play. The stands are wild. Cries of "Hold
&#39;em, Bernstein!" and "Touchdown, Capablanca!"
ring out on the frosty November air.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Brave voices are singing the fighting song entitled
"Capablanca&#39;s Day" which runs as follows:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p class="tei tei-l">"Oh, sweep, sweep across the board,</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">With your castles, queens, and pawns;</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">We are with you, all Havana&#39;s horde,</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">Till the sun of victory dawns;</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">Then it&#39;s fight, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">fight</span>, FIGHT!</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">To your last white knight,</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">For the truth must win alway,</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">And our hearts beat true</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">Old "J.R." for you</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">On Capa-blanca&#39;s Day."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></div>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Up to this point the game had proceeded along
the lines generally recommended by the masters,"
writes Capablanca. "The last move, however, is
a slight deviation from the regular course, which
brings this Knight back to B in order to leave open
the diagonal for the Q, and besides is more in accordance
with the defensive nature of the game.
Much more could be said as to the reasons that
make Kt - B the preferred move of most masters....
Of course, lest there be some misapprehension,
let me state that the move Kt - B is made in conjunction
with K R - K, which comes first."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is lucky that Mr. Casablanca made that explanation,
for I was being seized with just that
misapprehension which he feared. (Mr. <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Capablanca</span>,
I mean.)</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XXXVIII—"RIP VAN WINKLE"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">After all, there is nothing like a good folk-opera
for wholesome fun, and the boy who
can turn out a rollicking folk-opera for old and
young is Percy MacKaye. His latest is a riot from
start to finish. You can buy it in book form, published
by Knopf. Just ask for "Rip Van Winkle"
and spend the evening falling out of your chair.
(You wake up just as soon as you fall and are all
ready again for a fresh start.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Of course it is a little rough in spots, but you
know what Percy MacKaye is when he gets loose
on a folk-opera. It is good, clean Rabelaisian fun,
such as was in "Washington, the Man Who Made
Us." I always felt that it was very prudish of the
police to stop that play just as it was commencing
its run. Or maybe it wasn&#39;t the police that stopped
it. Something did, I remember.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But "Rip Van Winkle" has much more zip to it
than "Washington" had. In the first place, the
lyrics are better. They have more of a lilt to them
than the lines of the earlier work had. Here is the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>song hit of the first act, sung by the Goose Girl.
Try this over on your piano:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Kaaterskill, Kaaterskill,</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Cloud on the Kaaterskill!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Will it be fair, or lower?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Silver rings</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">On my pond I see;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">And my gander he</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Shook both his white wings</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Like a sunshine shower.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">I venture to say that Irving Berlin himself
couldn&#39;t have done anything catchier than that by
way of a lyric. Or this little snatch of a refrain
sung by the old women of the town:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Nay, nay, nay!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">A sunshine shower</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Won&#39;t last a half an hour.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">The trouble with most lyrics is that they are written
by song-writers who have had no education. Mr.
MacKaye&#39;s college training shows itself in every
line of the opera. There is a subtlety of rhyme-scheme,
a delicacy of meter, and, above all, an
originality of thought and expression which promises
much for the school of university-bred lyricists.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Here, for instance, is a lyric which Joe McCarthy
could never have written:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Up spoke Nancy, spanking Nancy,</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Says, "My feet are far too dancy, Dancy O!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">So foot-on-the-grass,</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Foot-on-the-grass,</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Foot-on-the-grass is my fancy, O!"</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">Of course this is a folk-opera. And you can get
away with a great deal of that "dancy-o" stuff
when you call it a folk-opera. You can throw it
all back on the old folk at home and they can&#39;t say
a word.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But even the local wits of Rip Van Winkle&#39;s time
would have repudiated the comedy lines which Mr.
MacKaye gives Rip to say in which "Katy-did"
and "Katy-didn&#39;t" figure prominently as the nub,
followed, before you have time to stop laughing, by
one about "whip poor Will" (whippoorwill—get
it?). If "Rip Van Winkle" is ever produced again,
Ed Wynn should be cast as Rip. He would eat that
line alive.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Ed Wynn, by the way, might do wonders by the
opera if he could get the rights to produce it in his
own way. Let Mr. MacKaye&#39;s name stay on the
programme, but give Ed Wynn the white card to do
<span class="tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as he might see fit with the book. For instance,
one of Mr. MacKaye&#39;s characters is named "Dirck
Spuytenduyvil." Let him stand as he is, but give
him two cousins, "Mynheer Yonkers" and "Jan
One Hundred and Eighty-third Street." The three
of them could do a comedy tumbling act. There is
practically no end to the features that could be introduced
to tone the thing up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The basic idea of "Rip Van Winkle" would lend
itself admirably to Broadway treatment, for Mr.
MacKaye has taken liberties, with the legend and
introduced the topical idea of a Magic Flask, containing
home-made hootch. Hendrick Hudson, the
Captain of the Catskill Bowling Team, is the lucky
possessor of the doctor&#39;s prescription and formula,
and it is in order to take a trial spin with the brew
that Rip first goes up to the mountain. Here are
Hendrick&#39;s very words of invitation:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">You&#39;ll be right welcome. I will let you taste</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">A wonder drink we brew aboard the Half Moon.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Whoever drinks the Magic Flask thereof</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Forgets all lapse of time</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">And wanders ever in the fairy season</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Of youth and spring.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Come join me in the mountains</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">At mid of night</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">And there I promise you the Magic Flask.</span></p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></div>

<p class="tei tei-p">And so at mid of night Rip fell for the promise
of wandering "in the fairy season," as so many
have done at the invitation of a man who has "made a
little something at home which you couldn&#39;t tell
from the real stuff." Rip got out of it easily. He
simply went to sleep for twenty years. You ought
to see a man I know.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is a note in the front of the volume saying
that no public reading of "Rip Van Winkle" may
be given without first getting the author&#39;s permission.
It ought to be made much more difficult to
do than that.<span class="tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">LUTHER F. NEAM, Flushing, L.I.—The poem
asked for by "E.J.K." was recited at a Free Soil riot
in Ashburg, Kansas, in July, 1850. It was entitled,
"And That&#39;s the Way They Did It When Grandma
Was a Girl," and was written by Bishop Leander B.
Rizzard. The last line runs:</p>

<p style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-p">"<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">And that&#39;s they way they did it, when Grandma

<p class="tei tei-p">I remember hearing these lines read at a gathering

questioned on the matter he did not deny it, simply
smiling and saying, "I&#39;m glad if you liked them."
They were henceforth known in Presto as "Dr.

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XL—"DARKWATER"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">We have so many, many problems in America.
Books are constantly being written offering
solutions for them, but still they persist.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There are volumes on auction bridge, family
budgets and mind-training. A great many people
have ideas on what should be done to relieve the
country of certain undesirable persons who have
displayed a lack of sympathy with American institutions.
(As if American institutions needed sympathy!)
And some of the more generous-minded
among us are writing books showing our duty to
the struggling young nationalities of Europe. It
is bewildering to be confronted by all these problems,
each demanding intelligent solution.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Little wonder, then, that we have no time for
writing books on the one problem which is exclusively
our own. With so many wrongs in the world
to be righted, who can blame us for overlooking
the one tragic wrong which lies at our door? With
so many heathen to whom the word of God must be
<span class="tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>brought and so many wild revolutionists in whom
must be instilled a respect for law and order, is it
strange that we should ourselves sometimes lump
the word of God and the principles of law and order
together under the head of "sentimentality" and
shrug our shoulders? Justice in the abstract is our
aim—any American will tell you that—so why
haggle over details and insist on justice for the
negro?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But W.E.B. Du Bois does insist on justice for
the negro, and in his book "Darkwater" (Harcourt,
Brace &amp; Co.) his voice rings out in a bitter
warning through the complacent quiet which usually
reigns around this problem of America. Mr. Du
Bois seems to forget that we have the affairs of a
great many people to attend to and persists in calling
our attention to this affair of our own. And
what is worse, in the minds of all well-bred persons
he does not do it at all politely. He seems to be
quite distressed about something.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Maybe it is because he finds himself, a man of
superior mind and of sensitive spirit who is a graduate
of Harvard, a professor and a sincere worker
for the betterment of mankind, relegated to an inferior
order by many men and women who are
obviously his inferiors, simply because he happens
<span class="tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to differ from them in the color of his skin. Maybe
it is because he sees the people of his own race who
have not had his advantages (if a negro may ever
be said to have received an advantage) being
crowded into an ignominious spiritual serfdom
equally as bad as the physical serfdom from
which they were so recently freed. Maybe it is
because of these things that Mr. Du Bois seems
overwrought.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Or perhaps it is because he reads each day of
how jealous we are, as a Nation, of the sanctity of
our Constitution, how we revere it and draw a flashing
sword against its detractors, and then sees this
very Constitution being flouted as a matter of course
in those districts where the amendment giving the
negroes a right to vote is popularly considered one
of the five funniest jokes in the world.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Perhaps he hears candidates for office insisting on
a reign of law or a plea for order above all things,
by some sentimentalist or other, or public speakers
advising those who have not respect for American
institutions to go back whence they came, and then
sees whole sections of the country violating every
principle of law and order and mocking American
institutions for the sake of teaching a "nigger"
his place.<span class="tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Perhaps during the war he heard of the bloody
crimes of our enemies, and saw preachers and editors
and statesmen stand aghast at the barbaric
atrocities which won for the German the name of
Hun, and then looked toward his own people and
saw them being burned, disembowelled and tortured
with a civic unanimity and tacit legal sanction which
made the word Hun sound weak.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Perhaps he has heard it boasted that in America
every man who is honest, industrious and intelligent
has a good chance to win out, and has seen honest,
industrious and intelligent men whose skins are black
stopped short by a wall so high and so thick that
all they can do, on having reached that far, is to
bow their heads and go slowly back.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Any one of these reasons should have been sufficient
for having written "Darkwater."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is unfortunate that Mr. Du Bois should have
raised this question of our own responsibility just
at this time when we were showing off so nicely. It
may remind some one that instead of taking over
a protectorate of Armenia we might better take over
a protectorate of the State of Georgia, which yearly
leads the proud list of lynchers. But then, there
will not be enough people who see Mr. Du Bois&#39;s
book to cause any great national movement, so we
are quite sure, for the time being, of being able to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>devote our energies to the solution of our other
problems.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Don&#39;t forget, therefore, to write your Congressman
about a universal daylight-saving bill, and give
a little thought, if you can, to the question of the
vehicular tunnel.<span class="tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XLI—THE NEW TIME-TABLE</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The new time-table of the New York Central
Railroad (New York Central Railroad, Harlem
Division. Form 113. Corrected to March 28,
1922) is an attractive folder, done in black and
white, for the suburban trade. It slips neatly into
the pocket, where it easily becomes lost among
letters and bills, appearing again only when you
have procured another.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">So much for its physical features. Of the text
matter it is difficult to write without passion. No
more disheartening work has been put on the market
this season.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In an attempt to evade the Daylight-Saving Law
the New York Central has kept its clocks at what
is called "Eastern Standard Time," meaning that
it is standard on East 42d Street between Vanderbilt
and Lexington Avenues. Practically everywhere
else in New York the clocks are an hour ahead.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is this "Eastern Standard Time" that gives
the time-table its distinctive flavor. Each train has
been demoted one hour, and then, for fear that it
<span class="tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would be too easy to understand this, an extra three
or four minutes have been thrown in or taken out,
just, so that no mistake can help being made.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In order to read the new time-table understandingly
the following procedure is now necessary:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Take a room in some quiet family hotel where
the noise from the street is reduced to minimum.
Place the time-table on the writing-desk and sit in
front of it, holding a pencil in the right hand and
a watch (Eastern Christian Time) in the left. Then
decide on the time you think you would like to
reach home. Let us say that you usually have
dinner at 7. You would, if you could do just what
you wanted, reach Valhalla at 6:30. Very well. It
takes about an hour from the Grand Central Terminal
to Valhalla. How about a train leaving around
5:30?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Look at the time-table for a train which leaves
about 2:45 (Eastern Standard Time). Write down,
"2:45" on a piece of paper. Add 150. Subtract
the number of stations that Valhalla is above White
Plains. Sharpen your pencil and bind up your cut
finger and subtract the number you first thought of,
and the result will show the number of Presidents
of the United States who have been assassinated
while in office. Then go over to the Grand Central
<span class="tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Terminal and ask one of the information clerks
what you want to know.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image14" id="image14" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image14.png" alt="&quot;Listen, Ed! This is how it goes!&quot;" class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">"Listen, Ed! This is how it goes!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They will be glad to see you, for during the last
three days they have been actually hungering for
the sight of a human face. Sometimes it has seemed
to them that the silence and loneliness there behind
the information counter would drive them mad. If
some one—any one—would only come and speak
to them! That is why one of them is over in the
corner chewing up time-tables into small balls and
playing marbles with them. He has gone mad from
loneliness. The other clerk, the one who is looking
at the tip of his nose and mumbling Lincoln&#39;s Gettysburg
Address, has only a few more minutes before
he too succumbs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And that low, rumbling sound, what is that? It
comes from the crowd of commuters standing in
front of the gate of what used to be the 5:56. Let
us draw near and hear what they are discussing.
Why, it is the new time-table, of all things!</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XLII—MR. BOK&#39;S AMERICANIZATION</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">If ever you should feel important enough to write
an autobiography to give to the world, and dislike
to say all the nice things about yourself that you
feel really ought to be said, just write it in the third
person. Edward Bok has done this in "The Americanization
of Edward Bok" and the effect is quite
touching in its modesty.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In "An Explanation" at the beginning of the
book Mr. Bok disclaims any credit for the winning
ways and remarkable success of his hero, Edward
Bok. Edward Bok, the little Dutch boy who landed
in America in 1870 and later became the editor of
the greatest women&#39;s advertising medium in the
country, is an entirely different person from the
Edward Bok who is telling the story. You understand
this to begin with. Otherwise you may misjudge
the author.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I have again and again found myself," writes
Mr. Bok, "watching with intense amusement and
interest the Edward Bok of this book at work....
His tastes, his outlook, his manner of looking at
<span class="tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>things were totally at variance with my own....
He has had and has been a personality apart from
my private self."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The only connection between Edward Bok the
editor and Edward Bok the autobiographer seems
to be that Editor Bok allows Author Bok to have
a checking account in his bank under their common
name.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Thus completely detached from his hero, Mr. Bok
proceeds and is able to narrate on page 3, in the
manner of Horatio Alger, how young Edward,
taunted by his Brooklyn schoolmates, gave a sound
thrashing to the ringleader, after which he found
himself "looking into the eyes of a crowd of very
respectful boys and giggling girls, who readily made
a passageway for his brother and himself when they
indicated a desire to leave the school-yard and go
home."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He can also, without seeming in the least conceited,
tell how, through his clear-sighted firmness in refusing
to write in the Spencerian manner prescribed in
school, he succeeded in bringing the Principal and
the whole Board of Education to their senses, resulting
in a complete reversal of the public-school policy
in the matter of handwriting instruction.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Horatio Alger note is dominant throughout
the story of young Edward&#39;s boyhood. His cheerfulness
<span class="tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and business sagacity so impressed everyone
with whom he came in contact that he was soon
outdistancing all the other boys in the process of
self-advancement. And no one is more smilingly
tolerant of the irresistible progress of young Edward
Bok in making friends and money than Edward Bok
the impersonal author of the book. He just loves
to see the young boy get ahead.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It will perhaps aid in getting an idea of the personality
and confident presence of the Boy Bok to state
that he was a feverish collector of autographs. Whenever
any famous personage came to town the young
man would find out at what hotel he was staying and
would proceed to hound him until he had got him
to write his name, with some appropriate sentiment,
in a little book. In advertising the present volume
the publishers give a list of names of historical characters
who feature in Mr. Bok&#39;s reminiscences—Gens.
Grant and Garfield, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Longfellow, Emerson and dozens of others. And so
they do figure in the book, but as victims of the
young Dutch boy&#39;s passion for autographs. Still,
perhaps, they did not mind, for the author gives us to
understand that they were all so charmed with the
prepossessing manner and intelligent bearing of the
young autograph hound that they not only were continually
<span class="tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>asking him to dinner (he usually timed his
visit so as to catch them just as they were entering
the dining-room) but insisted on giving him letters
of introduction to their friends.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Only Mrs. Abraham Lincoln and Ralph Waldo Emerson
neglected to register extreme pleasure at being
approached by the smiling lad. Both Mrs. Lincoln
and Emerson were failing in their minds at the time,
however, which satisfactorily explains their coolness,
at least for the author. In Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s case an
attempt was made to interest her in an autographed
photograph of Gen. Grant. But "Edward saw
that the widow of the great Lincoln did not mentally
respond to his pleasure in his possession."
Could it have been possible that the widow of the
great Lincoln was a trifle bored?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The account of the intrusion on Emerson in Concord
borders on the sacrilegious. Here was the venerable
philosopher, five months before his death,
when his great mind had already gone on before him,
being visited by a strange lad with a passion for
autographs, who sat and watched for those lucid
moments when then sun would break through the
clouded brain, making it possible for Emerson to
hold the pen and form the letters of his name. Then
young Edward was off, with another trophy in his
belt and another stride made in his progress toward
<span class="tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Americanization. Lovers of Emerson could wish
that the impersonal editor of these memoirs had
omitted the account of this victory.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Americanization seems, from the present document,
to consist of, first, making as many influential
friends as possible who may be able to help you at
some future time; second, making as much money
as possible (young Edward used his position as stenographer
to Jay Gould to glean tips on the market,
thereby cleaning up for himself and his Sunday-school
teacher at Plymouth Church), and third,
keeping your eye open for the main chance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In conclusion, nothing more fitting could be quoted
than the touching caption under the picture of the
author&#39;s grandmother, "who counselled each of her
children to make the world a better and more beautiful
place to live in—a counsel which is now being
carried on by her grandchildren, one of whom is Edward
Bok."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Could detachment of author and hero be more
complete?<span class="tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XLIII—ZANE GREY&#39;S MOVIE</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The hum of the moving-picture machine is the
predominating note in "The Mysterious
Rider," Zane Grey&#39;s latest contribution to the literature
of unrealism. All that is necessary for a complete
illusion is the insertion of three or four news
photographs at the end, showing how they catch
salmon in the Columbia River, the allegorical floats
in the Los Angeles Carnival of Roses and the ice-covered
fire ruins in the business section of Worcester,
Mass.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In order that the change from book to film may
be made as quickly as possible, the author has written
his story in the language of the moving-picture
subtitle. All that the continuity-writer in the studio
will have to do will be to take every third sentence
from the book and make a subtitle from it. We
might save him the trouble and do it here, together
with some suggestions for incidental decorations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Remember, nothing will be quoted below which is
not in the exact wording of Zane Grey&#39;s text.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>We first see Columbine Belllounds, adopted
daughter of old Belllounds the rancher of Colorado.
She is riding along the trail overlooking the valley.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"TODAY GIRLISH ORDEALS AND GRIEFS
SEEMED BACK IN THE PAST: SHE WAS A
WOMAN AT NINETEEN AND FACE TO FACE
WITH THE FIRST GREAT PROBLEM IN HER
LIFE." (Suggestion for title decoration: A pair
of reluctant feet standing at the junction of a brook
and a river.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She stops to pick some columbines and soliloquizes.
The author says: "She spoke aloud, as if
the sound of her voice might convince her," but it
is not clear from the text just what she expected to
be convinced of. Here is her argument to herself:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"COLUMBINE!... SO THEY NAMED
ME—THOSE MINERS WHO FOUND ME—A
BABY—LOST IN THE WOODS—ASLEEP
AMONG THE COLUMBINES." (Decorative
nasturtiums.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Having convinced herself in these reassuring
words as she stands alone on the ridge in God&#39;s
great outdoors, she explains that she has promised
to marry Jack Belllounds, the worthless son of her
foster-father, although any one can tell that she is
in love with Wilson Moore, a cow-puncher on the
ranch. You will understand what a sacrifice this
<span class="tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was to be when the author says that "the lower
part of Jack Belllounds&#39;s face was weak."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To the ranch comes "Hell-Bent" Wade, the mysterious
man of the plains. He applies for a job, and
not only that, but he gets it, which gives him a
chance to let us know that:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO HE HAD
DRIVEN THE WOMAN HE LOVED AWAY
FROM HIM, OUT INTO THE WORLD WITH
HER BABY GIRL ... JEALOUS FOOL!...
TOO LATE HAD HE DISCOVERED HIS
FATAL BLUNDER.... THAT WAS BENT
WADE&#39;S SECRET." (Fancy sketch of a secret.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And as we already know that Columbine is almost
nineteen (I think she told herself this fact
aloud once when she was out riding alone, just to
convince herself), the shock is not so great as it
might have been to hear Wade murmur aloud
(doubtless to convince himself too), "Baby would
have been—let&#39;s see—&#39;most nineteen years old
now—if she&#39;d lived."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Any bets on who Columbine really is?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Let us digress from the scenario a minute to cite
a scintillating passage, one of many in the book.
Wade is speaking:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;You can never tell what a dog is until you
<span class="tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>know him. Dogs are like men. Some of &#39;em look
good, but they&#39;re really bad. An&#39; that works the
other way round.&#39;"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Oscar Wilde stuff, that is. How often have you
felt the truth of what Mr. Grey says here, and yet
have never been able to put it into words! It is
this ability to put thoughts into words that makes
him one of our most popular authors today.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But enough of this. "Hell-Bent" Wade determines
that his little gel shall not know him as her
father, and, furthermore, that she shall not marry
Jack Belllounds. So he goes to the cabin of Wils
Moore and tells him that Columbine is unhappy at
the thought of her approaching—you guessed it—nuptials.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"PARD! SHE LOVES ME—STILL?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"WILS, HERS IS THE KIND THAT GROWS
STRONGER WITH TIME, I KNOW." (Heart
and an hour-glass intertwined.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Let it be said right here, however, that Jack
Belllounds, rough and villainous as he is, is the kind
of cow-puncher who says to his father: "I still
love you, dad, despite the cruel thing you did to
me." No cow-puncher who says "despite" can
be entirely bad. Neither can he be a cow-puncher.<span class="tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is later, after a thrilling series of physical
encounters, that Columbine tells Jack Belllounds in
so many words that she loves Wils Moore. "Then
Wade saw the glory of her—saw her mother again
in that proud, fierce uplift of face that flamed red
and then blazed white—saw hate and passion and
love in all their primal nakedness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"LOVE HIM! LOVE WILSON MOORE?
YES, YOU FOOL! I LOVE HIM! YES! YES!
YES!" (Decorative heart, in which a little door
slowly opens, showing the face of Columbine.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But time is short and there is a Semon comedy to
follow immediately after this. So all that we can
divulge is that Jack has Wils Moore wrongly accused
of cattle-rustling, bringing down on his own
head the following chatty bit from his affianced
bride:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"SO THAT&#39;S YOUR REVENGE.... BUT
YOU&#39;RE TO RECKON WITH ME, JACK
BELLLOUNDS! YOU VILLAIN! YOU DEVIL!
YOU"—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It would be unfair to the millions of readers who
will struggle for possession of the circulating-library
copies of "The Mysterious Rider" to tell just what
happens after this. But need we hesitate to divulge
that the final subtitle will be:<span class="tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;I HAVE FAITH AND HOPE AND LOVE,
FOR I AM HIS DAUGHTER.&#39; A FAINT, COOL
BREEZE STRAYED THROUGH THE ASPENS,
RUSTLING THE LEAVES WHISPERINGLY,
AND THE SLENDER COLUMBINES, GLEAMING
PALE IN THE TWILIGHT LIFTED

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XLIV—SUPPRESSING "JURGEN"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Of course it was silly to suppress "Jurgen."
That goes without saying. But it seems
equally silly, because of its being suppressed, to
hail it as high art. It is simply Mr. James Branch
Cabell&#39;s quaint way of telling a raw story and it
isn&#39;t particularly his own way, either. Personally,
I like the modern method much better.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jurgen" is a frank imitation of the old-time
pornographers and although it is a very good imitation,
it need not rank Mr. Cabell any higher than
the maker of a plaster-of-paris copy of some B[oe]otian
sculptural oddity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The author, in defense of his fortunate book,
lifts his eyebrows and says, "Honi soit." He
claims, and quite rightly, that everything he has
written has at least one decent meaning, and that
anyone who reads anything indecent into it automatically
convicts himself of being in a pathological
condition. The question is, if Mr. Cabell had been
convinced beforehand that nowhere in all this broad
land would there be anyone who would read another
<span class="tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>meaning into his lily-white words, would he ever
have bothered to write the book at all?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. Cabell is admittedly a genealogist. He is an
earnest student of the literature of past centuries.
He has become so steeped in the phrases and literary
mannerisms of the middle and upper-middle
ages that, even in his book of modern essays "Beyond
Life," he is constantly emitting strange words
which were last used by the correspondents
who covered the crusades. No man has to be as
artificially obsolete as Mr. Cabell is. He likes
to be.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In "Jurgen" he has simply let himself go. There
is no pretense of writing like a modern. There is
no pretense of writing in the style of even James
Branch Cabell. It is frankly "in the manner of"
those ancient authors whose works are sold surreptitiously
to college students by gentlemen who
whisper their selling-talk behind a line of red sample
bindings. And it is not in the manner of Rabelais,
although Rabelais&#39;s name has been frequently used
in describing "Jurgen." Rabelais seldom hid his
thought behind two meanings. There was only one
meaning, and you could take it or leave it. And
Rabelais would never have said "Honi soit" by
way of defense.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The general effect is one of Fielding or Sterne
<span class="tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>telling the story of Sir Gawain and the Green
Knight, with their own embellishments, to the boys
at the club.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If all that is necessary to produce a work of art
is to take a drummer&#39;s story and tell it in dusty
English, we might try our luck with the modern
smoking-car yarn about the traveling-man who
came to the country hotel late at night, and see
how far we can get with it in the manner of James
Branch Cabell imitating Fielding imitating someone
else.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is a tale which they narrate in Nouveau Rochelle,
saying: In the old days there came one night
a traveling man to an inn, and the night was late,
and he was sore beset, what with rag-tag-and-bob-tail.
Eftsoons he made known his wants to the
churl behind the desk, who was named Gogyrvan.
And thus he spake:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Any rooms?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Indeed, sir, no," was Gogyrvan&#39;s glose.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Now but this is an deplorable thing, God wot,"
says the traveling man. "Fie, brother, but you
think awry. Come, don smart your thinking-cap
and answer me again. An&#39; you have forgot my
query; it was: &#39;Any rooms, bo?&#39;"<span class="tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Whereat the churl behind the desk gat him down
from his stool and closed one eye in a wink.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There is one room," he says, and places his
forefinger along the side of his nose, in the manner
of a man who places his forefinger along the side of
his nose.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But at this point I am stopped short by the warning
passage through the room of a cold, damp current
of air as from the grave, and I know that it
is one of Mr. Sumner&#39;s vice deputies flitting by on
his rounds in defense of the public morals. So I
can go no further, for public morals must be defended
even at the cost of public morality (a statement
which means nothing but which sounds rather
well, I think. I shall try to work it in again some
time).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But perhaps enough has been said to show that
it is perfectly easy to write something that will
sound classic if you can only remember enough
old words. When Mr. Cabell has learned the language,
he ought to write a good book in modern
English. There are lots of people who read it and
they speak very highly of it as a means of expression.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But there are certain things that you cannot express
in it without sounding crass, which would be
a disadvantage in telling a story like "Jurgen."<span class="tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">While on the subject of books which we read
because we think we ought to, and while
Vicente Blasco Ibáñez is on the ocean and can&#39;t hear
what is being said, let&#39;s form a secret society.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I will be one of any three to meet behind a barn
and admit that I would not give a good gosh darn
if a fortune-teller were to tell me tomorrow that I
should never, never have a chance to read another
book by the great Spanish novelist.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Any of the American reading public who desire
to join this secret society may do so without
fear of publicity, as the names will not be given
out. The only means of distinguishing a fellow-member
will be a tiny gold emblem, to be worn in
the lapel, representing the figure (couchant) of
Spain&#39;s most touted animal. The motto will be
"Nimmermehr," which is a German translation of
the Spanish phrase "Not even once again."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Simply because I myself am not impressed by a
book, I have no authority to brand anyone who
<span class="tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>does not like it as a poseur and say that he is only
making believe that he likes it. And there must
be a great many highly literary people who really
and sincerely do think that Señor Blasco&#39;s books
are the finest novels of the epoch.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It would therefore be presumptuous of me to say
that Spain is now, for the first time since before
1898, in a position to kid the United States and,
vicariously through watching her famous son count
his royalties and gate receipts, to feel avenged for
the loss of her islands. If America has found something
superfine in Ibáñez that his countrymen have
missed, then America is of course to be congratulated
and not kidded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But probably no one was more surprised than
Blasco when he suddenly found himself a lion in
our literary arena instead of in his accustomed rôle
of bull in his home ring. And those who know say
that you could have knocked his compatriots over
with a feather when the news came that old man
Ibáñez&#39;s son had made good in the United States
to the extent of something like five hundred million
pesetas.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For, like the prophet whom some one was telling
about, Ibáñez was not known at home as a
particularly hot tamale. But, then, he never had
such a persistent publisher in Spain, and book-advertising
<span class="tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is not the art there that it is in America.
When the final accounting of the great success of
"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" in this
country is taken, honorable mention must be made
of the man at the E.P. Dutton &amp; Co. store who
had charge of the advertising.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The great Spanish novelist was in the French
propaganda service during the war. It was his
job to make Germany unpopular in Spanish. "The
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" is obviously
propaganda, and not particularly subtle propaganda
either. Certain chapters might have come direct
from our own Creel committee, and one may still
be true to the Allied cause and yet maintain that
propaganda and literature do not mix with any degree
of illusion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is no question, of course, that those chapters
in the book which are descriptive of the advance
and subsequent retreat of the German troops
under the eye of Don Marcelo are masterpieces of
descriptive reporting. But Philip Gibbs has given
us a whole book of masterpieces of descriptive
reporting which do not bear the stamp of approval
of the official propaganda bureau. And,
furthermore, Philip Gibbs does not wear a sport
shirt open at the neck. At least, he never had his
picture taken that way.<span class="tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As for the rest of the books that were dragged
out from the Spanish for "storehouse" when "The
Four Horsemen" romped in winners, I can speak
only as I would speak of "The World&#39;s Most Famous
Battles" or "Heroines in Shakespeare." I
have looked them over. I gave "Mare Nostrum"
a great deal of my very valuable time because the
advertisements spoke so highly of it. "Woman
Triumphant" took less time because I decided to
stop earlier in the book. "Blood and Sand" I
passed up, having once seen a Madrid bull-fight for
myself, which may account for this nasty attitude
I have toward any Spanish product. I am told,
however, that this is the best of them all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is remarkable that for a writer who seems to
have left such an indelible imprint in the minds of
the American people, whose works have been ranked
with the greatest of all time and who received more
publicity during one day of his visit here than
Charles Dickens received during his whole sojourn
in America, Señor Blasco and his works form a
remarkably small part of the spontaneous literary
conversation of the day. The characters which he
has created have not taken any appreciable hold
in the public imagination. Their names are never
used as examples of anything. Who were some of
his chief characters, by the way? What did they
<span class="tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>say that was worth remembering? What did they
do that characters have not been doing for many
generations? Did you ever hear anyone say, "He
talks like a character in Ibáñez," or "This might
have happened in one of Ibáñez&#39;s books"?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Of course it is possible for a man to write a great
book from which no one would quote. That is
probably happening all the time. But it is because
no one has read it. Here we have an author whose
vogue in this country, according to statistics, is equal
to that of any writer of novels in the world. And
as soon as his publicity department stops functioning,
I should like to lay a little bet that he will not
be heard of again.<span class="tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XLVI—ON BRICKLAYING</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">After a series of introspective accounts of
the babyhood, childhood, adolescence and inevitably
gloomy maturity of countless men and
women, it is refreshing to turn to "Bricklaying in
Modern Practice," by Stewart Scrimshaw. "Heigh-ho!"
one says. "Back to normal again!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For bricklaying is nothing if not normal, and Mr.
Scrimshaw has given just enough of the romantic
charm of artistic enthusiasm to make it positively
fascinating.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There was a time when man did not know how
to lay bricks," he says in his scholarly introductory
chapter on "The Ancient Art," "a time when he
did not know how to make bricks. There was a
time when fortresses and cathedrals were unknown,
and churches and residences were not to be seen
on the face of the earth. But today we see wonderful
architecture, noble and glorious structures,
magnificent skyscrapers and pretty home-like
bungalows."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To one who has been scouring Westchester
<span class="tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>County for the past two months looking at the
structures which are being offered for sale as homes,
"pretty home-like bungalows" comes as <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">le mot
juste</span>. They certainly are no more than pretty
home-like.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">One cannot read far in Mr. Scrimshaw&#39;s book
without blushing for the inadequacy of modern education.
We are turned out of our schools as educated
young men and women, and yet what college
graduate here tonight can tell me when the first
brick in America was made? Or even where it was
made?... I thought not.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Well, it was made in New Haven in 1650. Mr.
Scrimshaw does not say what it was made for,
but a conjecture would be that it was the handiwork
of Yale students for tactical use in the Harvard
game. (Oh, I know that Yale wasn&#39;t running in
1650, but what difference does that make in an
informal little article like this? It is getting so that
a man can&#39;t make any statement at all without being
caught up on it by some busybody or other.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But let&#39;s get down to the art itself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. Scrimshaw&#39;s first bit of advice is very sound.
"The bricklayer should first take a keen glance at
the scaffolding upon which he is to work, to see
that there is nothing broken or dangerous connected
<span class="tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with it.... This is essential, because more important
than anything else to him is the preservation
of his life and limb."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Oh, Mr. Scrimshaw, how true that is! If I were
a bricklayer I would devote practically my whole
morning inspecting the scaffolding on which I was
to work. Whatever else I shirked, I would put my
whole heart and soul into this part of my task.
Every rope should be tested, every board examined,
and I doubt if even then I would go up on the scaffold.
Any bricks that I could not lay with my feet
on terra firma (there is a joke somewhere about
terra cotta, but I&#39;m busy now) could be laid by
some one else.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But we don&#39;t seem to be getting ahead in our
instruction in practical bricklaying. Well, all right,
take this:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Pressed bricks, which are buttered, can be laid
with a one-eighth-inch joint, although a joint of
three-sixteenths of an inch is to be preferred."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Joe, get this gentleman a joint of three-sixteenths
of an inch, buttered. Service, that&#39;s our motto!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It takes a book like this to make a man realize
what he misses in his everyday life. For instance,
who would think that right here in New York there
<span class="tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were people who specialized in corbeling? Rain or
shine, hot or cold, you will find them corbeling
around like Trojans. Or when they are not corbeling
they may be toothing. (I too thought that this
might be a misprint for "teething," but it is spelled
"toothing" throughout the book, so I guess that
Mr. Scrimshaw knows what he is about.) Of all
departments of bricklaying I should think that it
would be more fun to tooth than to do anything
else. But it must be tiring work. I suppose that
many a bricklayer&#39;s wife has said to her neighbor,
"I am having a terrible time with my husband
this week. He is toothing, and comes home so cross
and irritable that nothing suits him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Another thing that a bricklayer has to be careful
of, according to the author (and I have no reason
to contest his warning), is the danger of stepping
on spawls. If there is one word that I would leave
with the young bricklayer about to enter his trade
it is "Beware of the spawls, my boy." They are
insidious, those spawls are. You think you are all
right and then—pouf! Or maybe "crash" would
be a better descriptive word. Whatever noise is
made by a spawl when stepped on is the one I want.
Perhaps "swawk" would do. I&#39;ll have to look up
"spawl" first, I guess.<span class="tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Well, anyway, there you have practical bricklaying
in a nutshell. Of course there are lots of
other points in the book and some dandy pictures
and it would pay you to read it. But in case you
haven&#39;t time, just skim over this résumé again and
you will have the gist of it.<span class="tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XLVII—"AMERICAN ANNIVERSARIES"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. Phillip R. Dillon has compiled and
published in his "American Anniversaries"
a book for men who do things. For every day in
the year there is a record of something which has
been accomplished in American history. For instance,
under Jan. 1 we find that the parcel-post
system was inaugurated in the United States in
1913, while Jan. 2 is given as the anniversary of
the battle of Murfreesboro (or Stone&#39;s River, as you
prefer). The whole book is like that; just one
surprise after another.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What, for instance, do you suppose that Saturday
marked the completion of?... Presuming that
no one has answered correctly, I will disclose (after
consulting Mr. Dillon&#39;s book) that July 31 marked
the completion of the 253d year since the signing
of the Treaty of Breda. But what, you may say—and
doubtless are saying at this very minute—what
has the Treaty of Breda (which everyone knows
was signed in Holland by representatives of England,
France, Holland and Denmark) got to do with
<span class="tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>American history? And right there is where Mr.
Dillon and I would have you. In the Treaty of
Breda, Acadia (or Nova Scotia) was given to France
and New York and New Jersey were confirmed to
England. So, you see, inhabitants of New York
and New Jersey (and, after all, who isn&#39;t?) should
have especial cause for celebrating July 31 as
Breda Day, for if it hadn&#39;t been for that treaty
we might have belonged to Poland and been mixed
up in all the mess that is now going on over
there.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I must confess that I turned to the date of the
anniversary of my own birth with no little expectation.
Of course I am not so very well known except
among the tradespeople in my town, but I should be
willing to enter myself in a popularity contest with
the Treaty of Breda. But evidently there is a
conspiracy of silence directed against me on the
part of the makers of anniversary books and calendars.
While no mention was made of my having
been born on Sept. 15, considerable space was given
to recording the fact that on that date in 1840 a
patent for a knitting machine was issued to the
inventor, who was none other than Isaac Wixan
Lamb of Salem, Mass.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now I would be the last one to belittle the importance
<span class="tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of knitting or the invention of a knitting
machine. I know some very nice people who knit
a great deal. But really, when it comes to anniversaries
I don&#39;t see where Isaac Wixon Lamb gets off
to crash in ahead of me or a great many other
people that I could name. And it doesn&#39;t help any,
either, to find that James Fenimore Cooper and
William Howard Taft are both mentioned as having
been born on that day or that the chief basic patent
for gasoline automobiles in America was issued in
1895 to George B. Selden. It certainly was a big
day for patents. But one realizes more than ever
after reading this section that you have to have a
big name to get into an anniversary book. The average
citizen has no show at all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In spite of these rather obvious omissions, Mr.
Dillon&#39;s Book is both valuable and readable. Especially
in those events which occurred early in the
country&#39;s history is there material for comparison
with the happenings of the present day, events
which will some day be incorporated in a similar
book compiled by some energetic successor of Mr.
Dillon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For instance, under Oct. 27, 1659, we find that
William Robinson and Marmaduke Stevenson were
banished from New Hampshire on the charge of being
<span class="tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Quakers and were later executed for returning to
the colony. Imagine!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And on Dec. 8, 1837, Wendell Phillips delivered
his first abolition speech at Boston in Faneuil Hall,
as a result of which he got himself known around
Boston as an undesirable citizen, a dangerous radical
and a revolutionary trouble-maker. It hardly seems
possible now, does it?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And on July 4, 1776—but there, why rub it in?<span class="tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XLVIII—A WEEK-END WITH WELLS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the February Bookman there is an informal
article by John Elliot called "At Home with H.G.
Wells" in which we are let in on the ground floor
in the Wells household and shown "H.G." (as his
friends and his wife call him) at play. It is an
interesting glimpse at the small doings of a great
man, but there is one feature of those doings which
has an ominous sound.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The Wells that everyone loves who sees him
at Easton is the human Wells, the family Wells,
the jovial Wells, Wells the host of some Sunday
afternoon party. For a distance of ten or twenty
miles round folks come on Sunday to play hockey
and have tea. Old and young—people from down
London who never played hockey before in their
lives; country farmers and their daughters, and
everybody else who lives in the district—troop over
and bring whoever happens to be the week-end
guest. Wells is delightful to them all. He doesn&#39;t
give a rap if they are solid Tories, Bolsheviks, Liberals,
or men and women of no political leanings,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Can you play hockey? is all that matters. If you
say No you are rushed toward a pile of sticks and
given one and told to go in the forward line; if you
say Yes you are probably made a vice captain on
the spot."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I am frank to confess that this sounds perfectly
terrible to me. I can&#39;t imagine a worse place in
which to spend a week-end than one where your host
is always boisterously forcing you to take part in
games and dances about which you know nothing.
A week-end guest ought to be ignored, allowed to
rummage about alone among the books, live stock
and cold food in the ice-box whenever he feels like
it, and not rushed willy-nilly (something good could
be done using the famous Willy-Nilly correspondence
as a base, but not here), into whatever the
family itself may consider a good time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In such a household as the Wells household must
be you are greeted by your hostess in a robust
manner with "So glad you&#39;re on time. The match
begins at two." And when you say "What match,"
you are told that there is a little tennis tournament
on for the week-end and that you and Hank are
scheduled to start the thing off with a bang. "But
I haven&#39;t played tennis for five years," you protest,
thinking of the delightful privacy of your own little
<span class="tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hall bedroom in town. "Never mind, it will all
come back to you. Bill has got some extra things
all put out for you upstairs." So you start off your
week-end by making a dub of yourself and are
known from that afternoon on by the people who
didn&#39;t catch your name as "the man who had such
a funny serve."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Or if it isn&#39;t that, it&#39;s dancing. Immediately
after dinner, just as you are about to settle down
for a comfortable evening by the fire, you notice
that they are rolling back the rugs. "House-cleaning?"
you suggest, with a nervous little laugh. "Oh,
no, just a little dancing in your honor." And then
you tell them that your honor will be satisfied
perfectly without dancing, that you haven&#39;t danced
since you left school, that you don&#39;t dance very
well, or that you have hurt your foot; to which the
only reply is an encouraging laugh and a hail-fellow-well-met
push out into the middle of the floor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A pox on both your house parties!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And yet, in a way, that is just what one might
expect from Mr. Wells. He has done the same
thing to me in his books many a time. I personally
have but little facility for world-repairing. I haven&#39;t
the slightest idea of how one would go about making
things better. And yet before I am more than two-thirds
<span class="tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the way through "Joan and Peter" or
"The Undying Fire" or "The Outline of History,"
Mr. Wells has me out on the hockey-field waving
a stick with a magnificent enthusiasm but no aim,
rushing up and down and calling, "Come on, now!"
to no one in particular.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">No matter how discouraging things seem when I
pick up a Wells book, or how averse I may be to
launching out on a crusade of any sort, I always
end by walking with a firm step to the door (feeling,
somehow, that I have grown quite a bit taller and
much handsomer) and saying quietly: "Meadows,
my suit of armor, please; the one with a chain-mail
shirt and a purple plume."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This, of course, is silly, as any of Mr. Wells&#39;s
critics will tell you. It is the effect that he has on
irresponsible, visionary minds. But if all the irresponsible,
visionary minds in the world become sufficiently
belligerent through a continued reading of
Mr. Wells, or even of the New Testament, who
knows but what they may become just practical
enough to take a hand at running things? They
couldn&#39;t do much worse than the responsible, practical
minds have done, now, could they?<span class="tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">XLIX—ABOUT PORTLAND CEMENT</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Portland cement is "the finely pulverized
product resulting from the calcination to incipient
fusion of an intimate mixture of properly
proportioned argillaceous and calcareous materials
and to which no addition greater than 3 per cent
has been made subsequent to calcination."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That, in a word, is the keynote of H. Colin Campbell&#39;s
"How to Use Cement for Concrete Construction."
In case you should never read any more of
the book, you would have that.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But to the reader who is not satisfied with this
taste of the secret of cement construction and who
reads on into Mr. Campbell&#39;s work, there is revealed
a veritable mine of information. And in the light
of the recent turn of events one might even call it
significant. (Any turn of events will do.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first chapter is given over to a plea for concrete.
Judging from the claims made for concrete
by Mr. Campbell, it will accomplish everything that
a return to Republican administration would do,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near so costly. It will
make your barn fireproof; it will insure clean milk
for your children; it will provide a safe housing
for your automobile. Farm prosperity and concrete go
hand in hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In case there are any other members of society
who have been with me in thinking that Portland
cement is a product of Portland, Me., or Portland,
Ore., it might as well be stated right here and now
that America had nothing to do with the founding
of the industry, and that the lucky Portland is an
island off the south coast of England.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was a bright sunny afternoon in May, 1824,
when Joseph Aspdin, an intelligent bricklayer of
Leeds, England, was carelessly calcining a mixture
of limestone and clay, as bricklayers often do on
their days off, that he suddenly discovered, on reducing
the resulting clinker to a powder, that this
substance, on hardening, resembled nothing so much
as the yellowish-gray stone found in the quarries on
the Isle of Portland. (How Joe knew what grew
on the Isle of Portland when his home was in Leeds
is not explained. Maybe he spent his summers at
the Portland House, within three minutes of the
bathing beach.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At any rate, on discovering the remarkable similarity
between the mess he had cooked up and Portland
<span class="tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stone, he called to his wife and said: "Eunice,
come here a minute! What does this remind you
of?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The usually cheerful brow of Eunice Aspdin
clouded for the fraction of a second.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That night up at Bert and Edna&#39;s?" she ventured.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, no, my dear," said the intelligent bricklayer,
slightly irked. "Anyone could see that this
here substance is a dead ringer for Portland stone,
and I am going to make heaps and heaps of it and
call it &#39;Portland cement.&#39; It is little enough that I
can do for the old island."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And so that&#39;s how Portland cement was named.
Rumor hath it that the first Portland cement in
America was made at Allentown, Pa., in 1875, but
I wouldn&#39;t want to be quoted as having said that.
But I will say that the total annual production in
this country is now over 90,000,000 barrels.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is interesting to note that cement is usually
packed in cloth sacks, although sometimes paper
bags are used.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A charge is made for packing cement in paper
bags," the books says. "These, of course, are not
redeemable."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">One can understand their not wanting to take
<span class="tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>back a paper bag in which cement has been
wrapped. The wonder is that the bag lasts until
you get home with it. I tried to take six cantaloups
home in a paper bag the other night and had
a bad enough time of it. Cement, when it is in
good form, must be much worse than cantaloup, and
the redeemable remnants of the bag must be negligible.
But why charge extra for using paper bags?
That seems like adding whatever it is you add to
injury. Apologies, rather than extra charge, should
be in order. However, I suppose that these cement
people understand their business. I shall
know enough to watch out, however, and insist on
having whatever cement I may be called upon to
carry home done up in a cloth sack. "Not in a
paper bag, if you please," I shall say very politely
to the clerk.<span class="tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Things have come to a pretty pass when a
man can&#39;t buy a bookcase that hasn&#39;t got
glass doors on it. What are we becoming—a nation
of weaklings?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">All over New York city I have been,—trying to
get something in which to keep books. And what
am I shown? Curio cabinets, inclosed whatnots,
museum cases in which to display fragments from
the neolithic age, and glass-faced sarcophagi for
dead butterflies.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But I am apt to use my books at any time,"
I explain to the salesman. "I never can tell when
it is coming on me. And when I want a book I
want it quickly. I don&#39;t want to have to send down
to the office for the key, and I don&#39;t want to have
to manipulate any trick ball-bearings and open up
a case as if I were getting cream-puffs out for a
customer. I want a bookcase for books and not
books for a bookcase."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">(I really don&#39;t say all those clever things to the
clerk. It took me quite a while to think them up.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>What I really say is, timidly, "Haven&#39;t you any
bookcases without glass doors?" and when they
say "No," I thank them and walk into the nearest
dining-room table.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But if they keep on getting arrogant about it I
shall speak up to them one of these fine days.
When I ask for an open-faced bookcase they look
with a scornful smile across the salesroom toward
the mahogany four-posters and say:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, no, we don&#39;t carry those any more. We
don&#39;t have any call for them. Every one uses the
glass-doored ones now. They keep the books much
cleaner."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then the ideal procedure for a real book-lover
would be to keep his books in the original box,
snugly packed in excelsior, with the lid nailed down.
Then they would be nice and clean. And the sun
couldn&#39;t get at them and ruin the bindings. Faugh!
(Try saying that. It doesn&#39;t work out at all as
you think it&#39;s going to. And it makes you feel
very silly for having tried it.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Why, in the elder days bookcases with glass doors
were owned only by people who filled them with
ten volumes of a pictorial history of the Civil War
(including some swell steel engravings), "Walks
<span class="tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and Talks with John L. Stoddard" and "Daily
Thoughts for Daily Needs," done in robin&#39;s-egg blue
with a watered silk bookmark dangling out. A set
of Sir Walter Scott always helps fill out a bookcase
with glass doors. It looks well from the front
and shows that you know good literature when you
see it. And you don&#39;t have to keep opening and
shutting the doors to get it out, for you never want
to get it out.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image15" id="image15" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image15.png" alt="I thank them and walk into the nearest dining-room table." class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">I thank them and walk into the nearest dining-room table.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A bookcase with glass doors used to be a sign
that somewhere in the room there was a crayon portrait
of Father when he was a young man, with a
real piece of glass stuck on the portrait to represent
a diamond stud.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And now we are told that "every one buys bookcases
with glass doors; we have no call for others."
Soon we shall be told that the thing to do is to buy
the false backs of bindings, such as they have in
stage libraries, to string across behind the glass.
It will keep us from reading too much, and then,
too, no one will want to borrow our books.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But one clerk told me the truth. And I am just
fearless enough to tell it here. I know that it will
kill my chances for the Presidency, but I cannot
stop to think of that.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After advising me to have a carpenter build me
<span class="tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the kind of bookcase I wanted, and after I had told
him that I had my name in for a carpenter but
wasn&#39;t due to get him until late in the fall, as he
was waiting for prices to go higher before taking
the job on, the clerk said:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s it. It&#39;s the price. You see the furniture
manufacturers can make much more money
out of a bookcase with glass doors than they can
without. When by hanging glass doors on a piece
of furniture at but little more expense to themselves
they can get a much bigger profit, what&#39;s the
sense in making them without glass doors? They
have just stopped making them, that&#39;s all."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">So you see the American people are being practically
forced into buying glass doors whether they
want them or not. Is that right? Is it fair?
Where is our personal liberty going to? What is
becoming of our traditional American institutions?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I don&#39;t know.<span class="tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LI—TROUT-FISHING</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">I never knew very much about trout-fishing
anyway, and I certainly had no inkling that a
trout-fisher had to be so deceitful until I read
"Trout-Fishing in Brooks," by G. Garrow-Green.
The thing is appalling. Evidently the sport is
nothing but a constant series of compromises with
one&#39;s better nature, what with sneaking about pretending
to be something that one is not, trying to
fool the fish into thinking one thing when just the
reverse is true, and in general behaving in an underhanded
and tricky manner throughout the day.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The very first and evidently the most important
exhortation in the book is, "Whatever you do,
keep out of sight of the fish." Is that open and
above-board? Is it honorable?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Trout invariably lie in running water with their
noses pointed against the current, and therefore
whatever general chance of concealment there may
be rests in fishing from behind them. The moral
is that the brook-angler must both walk and fish
upstream."<span class="tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It seems as if a lot of trouble might be saved
the fisherman, in case he really didn&#39;t want to walk
upstream but had to get to some point downstream
before 6 o&#39;clock, to adopt some disguise which
would deceive the fish into thinking that he had
no intention of catching them anyway. A pair of
blue glasses and a cane would give the effect of
the wearer being blind and harmless, and could be
thrown aside very quickly when the time came to
show one&#39;s self in one&#39;s true colors to the fish. If
there were two anglers they might talk in loud
tones about their dislike for fish in any form, and
then, when the trout were quite reassured and swimming
close to the bank they could suddenly be shot
with a pistol.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But a little further on comes a suggestion for a
much more elaborate bit of subterfuge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The author says that in the early season trout
are often engaged with larvae at the bottom and do
not show on the surface. It is then a good plan,
he says, to sink the flies well, moving in short jerks
to imitate nymphs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">You can see that imitating a nymph will call for
a lot of rehearsing, but I doubt very much if moving
in short jerks is the way in which to go about it.
I have never actually seen a nymph, though if I
<span class="tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had I should not be likely to admit it, and I can
think of no possible way in which I could give an
adequate illusion of being one myself. Even the
most stupid of trout could easily divine that I was
masquerading, and then the question would immediately
arise in its mind: "If he is not a nymph,
then what is his object in going about like that trying
to imitate one? He is up to no good, I&#39;ll be
bound."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And crash! away would go the trout before I
could put my clothes back on.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is an interesting note on the care and feeding
of worms on page 67. One hundred and fifty
worms are placed in a tin and allowed to work
their way down into packed moss.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A little fresh milk poured in occasionally is
sufficient food," writes Mr. Garrow-Green, in the
style of Dr. Holt. "So disposed, the worms soon
become bright, lively and tough."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is easy to understand why one should want
to have bright worms, so long as they don&#39;t know
that they are bright and try to show off before
company, but why deliberately set out to make
them tough? Good manners they may not be expected
to acquire, but a worm with a cultivated
vulgarity sounds intolerable. Imagine 150 very
<span class="tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tough worms all crowded together in one tin!
"Canaille" is the only word to describe it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I suppose that it is my ignorance of fishing parlance
which makes the following sentence a bit hazy:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Much has been written about bringing a fish
downstream to help drown it, as no doubt it does;
still, this is often impracticable."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I can think of nothing more impracticable than
trying to drown a fish under any conditions,
upstream or down, but I suppose that Mr. Garrow-Green
knows what he is talking about.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And in at least one of his passages I follow him
perfectly. In speaking of the time of day for fly-fishing
in the spring he says:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Carpe diem&#39; is a good watchword when trout
are in the humor." At least, I know a good pun
when I see one.<span class="tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LII—"SCOUTING FOR GIRLS"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Scouting for Girls" is not the kind of
book you think it is. The verb "to scout"
is intransitive in this case. As a matter of fact,
instead of being a volume of advice to men on how
to get along with girls, it is full of advice to girls
on how to get along without men, that is, within
reason, of course.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is issued by the Girl Scouts and is very subtle
anti-man propaganda. I can&#39;t find that men are
mentioned anywhere in the book. It is given over
entirely to telling girls how to chop down trees,
tie knots in ropes, and things like that. Now, as
a man, I am very jealous of my man&#39;s prerogative
of chopping down trees and tying knots in ropes,
and I resent the teaching of young girls to usurp
my province in these matters. Any young girl who
has taken one lesson in knot-tying will be able to
make me appear very silly at it. After two lessons
she could tie me hand and foot to a tree and go
away with my watch and commutation ticket. And
then I would look fine, wouldn&#39;t I? Small wonder
<span class="tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to me that I hail the Girl Scout movement as a
menace and urge its being nipped in the bud as you
would nip a viper in the bud. I would not be surprised
if there were Russian Soviet money back of
it somewhere.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A companion volume to "Scouting for Girls" is
"Campward, Ho!" a manual for Girl Scout camps.
The keynote is sounded on the first page by a
quotation from Chaucer, beginning:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">"When that Aprille with his schowres swoote</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">The drought of March hath perced to the roote,</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">And bathus every veyne in swich licour,</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Of which vertue engendred is the flour."</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">One can almost hear the girls singing that of an
evening as they sit around the campfire tying knots
in ropes. It is really an ideal camping song, because
even the littlest girls can sing the words without
understanding what they mean.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But it really lacks the lilt of the "Marching
Song" printed further on in the book. This is to
be sung to the tune of "Where Do We Go From
Here, Boys?" Bear this in mind while humming
it to yourself:<span class="tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<h1 class="tei tei-head"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">MARCHING SONG</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Where do we go from here, girls, where do we go from here?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Anywhere (our Captain<a name="noteref_5" id="noteref_5"></a><a href="#note_5"><span class="footnoteref">5</span></a>) leads we&#39;ll follow, never fear.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">The world is full of dandy girls, but wait till we appear—</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Then!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-l"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Girl Scouts, Girl Scouts, give us a hearty cheer!</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">A very stirring marching song, without doubt,
but what would they do if the leader&#39;s name
happened to be something like Mary Louise Abercrombie
or Elizabeth Van Der Water? They just
couldn&#39;t have a Captain with such a long name,
that&#39;s all. And there you have unfair discrimination
creeping into your camp right at the start.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In "Scouting for Girls" there is some useful
information concerning smoke signals. In case you
are lost, or want to communicate with your friends
who are beyond shouting distance, it is much
quicker than telephoning to build a clear, hot fire
and cover it with green stuff or rotten wood so that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it will send up a solid column of black smoke. By
spreading and lifting a blanket over this smudge
the column can be cut up into pieces, long or short
(this is the way it explains it in the book, but it
doesn&#39;t sound plausible to me), and by a preconcerted
code these can be made to convey tidings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For instance, one steady smoke means "Here
is camp."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Two steady smokes mean "I am lost. Come
and help me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Three smokes in a row mean "Good news!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I suppose that the Pollyanna of the camping
party is constantly sending up three smokes in a
row on the slightest provocation, and then when
the rest of the outfit have raced across country for
miles to find out what the good news is she probably
shows them, with great enthusiasm, that some
fringed gentians are already in blossom or that the
flicker&#39;s eggs have hatched. Unfortunately, there is
no smoke code given for snappy replies, but in the
next paragraph it tells how to carry on a conversation
with pistol shots. One of these would serve
the purpose for repartee.<span class="tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LIII—HOW TO SELL GOODS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Retail Merchants&#39; Association ought to
buy up all the copies of "Elements of Retail
Salesmanship," by Paul Westley Ivey (Macmillan),
and not let a single one get into the hands of a
customer, for once the buying public reads what is
written there the game is up. It tells all about how
to sell goods to people, how to appeal to their weaknesses,
how to exert subtle influences which will win
them over in spite of themselves. Houdini might
as well issue a pamphlet giving in detail his methods
of escape as for the merchants of this country to
let this book remain in circulation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The art of salesmanship is founded, according to
Mr. Ivey, on, first, a thorough knowledge of the
goods which are to be sold, and second, a knowledge
of the customer. By knowing the customer
you know what line of argument will most appeal
to him. There are several lines in popular use.
First is the appeal to the instinct of self-preservation—i.e.,
social self-preservation. The customer
is made to feel that in order to preserve her social
<span class="tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>standing she must buy the article in question. "She
must be made to feel what a disparaged social self
would mean to her mental comfort."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is reassuring to know that it is a recognized
ruse on the part of the salesman to intimate that
unless you buy a particular article you will have
to totter through life branded as the arch-piker.
I have always taken this attitude of the clerks
perfectly seriously. In fact, I have worried quite
a bit about it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the store where I am allowed to buy my clothes
it is quite the thing among the salesmen to see which
one of them can degrade me most. They intimate
that, while they have no legal means of refusing
to sell their goods to me, it really would be much
more in keeping with things if I were to take the
few pennies that I have at my disposal and run
around the corner to some little haberdashery for
my shirts and ties. Every time I come out from
that store I feel like Ethel Barrymore in "Déclassée."
Much worse, in fact, for I haven&#39;t any
good looks to fall back upon.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p"><a name="image16" id="image16" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<img src="images/image16.png" alt="They intimate that I had better take my few pennies and run &#39;round the corner to some little haberdashery." class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">They intimate that I had better take my few
pennies and run &#39;round the corner to some little haberdashery.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But now that I know the clerks are simply acting
all that scorn in an attempt to appeal to my instinct
for the preservation of my social self, I can
face them without flinching. When that pompous
<span class="tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>old boy with the sandy mustache who has always
looked upon me as a member of the degenerate Juke
family tries to tell me that if I don&#39;t take the
five-dollar cravat he won&#39;t be responsible for the
way in which decent people will receive me when
I go out on the street, I will reach across the counter
and playfully pull his own necktie out from
his waistcoat and scream, "I know you, you old
rascal! You got that stuff from page 68 of &#39;Elements
of Retail Salesmanship&#39; (Macmillan)."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Other traits which a salesperson may appeal to
in the customer are: Vanity, parental pride, greed,
imitation, curiosity and selfishness. One really
gets in touch with a lot of nice people in this work
and can bring out the very best that is in them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Customers are divided into groups indicative of
temperament. There is first the Impulsive or
Nervous Customer. She is easily recognized because
she walks into the store in "a quick, sometimes
jerky manner. Her eyes are keen-looking;
her expression is intense, oftentimes appearing
strained." She must be approached promptly, according
to the book, and what she desires must be
quickly ascertained. Since these are the rules for
selling to people who enter the store in this manner,
it might be well, no matter how lethargic you may
<span class="tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>be by nature, to assume the appearance of the Impulsive
or Nervous Customer as soon as you enter
the store, adopting a quick, even jerky manner and
making your eyes as keen-looking as possible, with
an intense expression, oftentimes appearing strained.
Then the clerk will size you up as type No. 1 and
will approach you promptly. After she has quickly
filled your order you may drop the impulsive pose
and assume your natural, slow manner again, whereupon
the clerk will doubtless be highly amused at
having been so cleverly fooled into giving quick
service.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The opposite type is known as the Deliberate
Customer. She walks slowly and in a dignified
manner. Her facial expression is calm and poised.
"Gestures are uncommon, but if existing tend to
be slow and inconspicuous." She can wait.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then there is the Vacillating or Indecisive Customer,
the Confident or Decisive Customer (this
one should be treated with subtle flattery and agreement
with all her views), The Talkative or Friendly
Customer, and the Silent or Indifferent one. All
these have their little weaknesses, and the perfect
salesperson will learn to know these and play to them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There seems to be only one thing left for the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>customer to do in order to meet this concerted
attack upon his personality. That is, to hire some
expert like Mr. Ivey to study the different types of
sales men and women and formulate methods of
meeting their offensive. Thus, if I am of the type
designated as the Vacillating or Indecisive Customer,
I ought to know what to do when confronted
by a salesman of the Aristocratic, Scornful type, so
that I may not be bulldozed into buying something
I do not want.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If I could only find such a book of instructions
I would go tomorrow and order a black cotton
engineer&#39;s shirt from that sandy-mustached salesman
and bawl him out if he raised his eyebrows.
But not having the book, I shall go in and, without
a murmur, buy a $3 silk shirt for $18 and slink out
feeling that if I had been any kind of sport at all
I would also have bought that cork helmet in the
showcase.<span class="tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the window of the grocery store to which I
used to be sent after a pound of Mocha and
Java mixed and a dozen of your best oranges, there
was a cardboard figure of a clerk in a white coat
pointing his finger at the passers-by. As I remember,
he was accusing you of not taking home
a bottle of Moxie, and pretty guilty it made you
feel too.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This man was, I believe, the pioneer in what has
since become a great literary movement. He
founded the "You, Mr. Business-Man!" school of
direct appeal. It is strictly an advertising property
and has long been used to sell merchandise to people
who never can resist the flattery of being addressed
personally. When used as an advertisement it is
usually accompanied by an illustration built along
the lines of the pioneer grocery-clerk, pointing a
virile finger at you from the page of the magazine,
and putting the whole thing on a personal basis by
addressing you as "You, Mr. Rider-in-the-Open-Cars!"

<p class="tei tei-p">In straight reading-matter, bound in book form
and sold as literature, this Moxie talk becomes a
volume of inspirational sermonizing, and instead of
selling cooling drinks or warming applications, it
throws dynamic paragraph after dynamic paragraph
into the fight for efficiency, concentration, self-confidence
and personality on the part of our body
politic. A homely virtue such as was taught us at
our mother&#39;s knee (or across our mother&#39;s knees)
at the age of four, in a dozen or so simple words,
is taken and blown up into a book in which it is
stated very impressively in a series of short, snappy
sentences, all saying the same thing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Such a book is called, for instance "You," written
by Irving R. Allen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You" takes 275 pages to divulge a secret of
success. It would not be fair to Mr. Allen to give
it away here after he has spent so much time concealing
it. But it might be possible to give some
idea of the importance of Mr. Allen&#39;s discovery by
stating one of my own, somewhat in the manner in
which he has stated his. I will give my little contribution

<p class="tei tei-p">You and I are alone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">No, don&#39;t try to get away. That door is locked.
I won&#39;t hurt you—much.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What I want to do is make you see yourself.
I want you, when you put down this book, to say,
"I know myself!" I want you to be able to look

I remember you, Mr. Addington Simms of Seattle,
you old Rotary Club dog! How&#39;s your merger?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And the only way that you can ever be able to
do this is to read this book through.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then read it through again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What is this rule? you may ask.</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LV—THE CATALOGUE SCHOOL</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Without wishing in the least to detract
from the praise due to Sinclair Lewis for
the remarkable accuracy with which he reports details
in his "Main Street," it is interesting to speculate
on how other books might have read had their
authors had Mr. Lewis&#39;s flair for minutiae and their
publishers enough paper to print the result.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For instance, Carol Kennicott, the heroine, whenever
she is overtaken by an emotional scene, is
given to looking out at the nearest window to hide
her feelings, whereupon the author goes to great
lengths to describe just exactly what came within
her range of vision. Nothing escapes him, even to
shreds of excelsior lying on the ground in back of
Howland &amp; Gould&#39;s grocery store.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Let us suppose that Harriet Beecher Stowe had
been endowed with Mr. Lewis&#39;s gift for reporting
and had indulged herself in it to the extent of the
following in "Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin:"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Slowly Simon Legree raised his whip-arm to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>strike the prostrate body of the old negro. As he
did so his eye wandered across the plantation to the
slaves&#39; quarters which crouched blistering in the
sun. Cowed as they were, as only ramshackle buildings
can be cowed, they presented their gray
boards, each eaten with four or five knot-holes, to
the elements in abject submission. The door of one
hung loose by a rust-encased hinge, of which only
one screw remained on duty, and that by sheer willpower
of two or three threads. Legree could not
quite make out how many threads there were on
the screw, but he guessed, and Simon Legree&#39;s guess
was nearly always right. On the ground at the
threshold lay a banjo G string, curled like a blond
snake ready to strike at the reddish, brown inner
husk of a nut of some sort which was blowing about
within reach. There were also several crumbs of
corn-pone, well-done, a shred of tobacco which had
fallen from the pipe of some negro slave before the
fire had consumed more than its very tip, an old
shoe which had, Legree noticed by the maker&#39;s
name, been bought in Boston in its palmier days,
doubtless by a Yankee cousin of one of Uncle
Tom&#39;s former owners, and an indiscriminate pile of
old second editions of a Richmond newspaper,
sweet-potato peelings and seeds of unripe watermelons.<span class="tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Swish! The blow descended on the crouching
form of Uncle Tom."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Or Sir Walter Scott:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sadly Rowena turned from her lover&#39;s side and
looked out over the courtyard of the castle. Beneath
her she saw the cobble-stones all scratched
and marred with gray bruises from the horses&#39; hoofs,
a faded purple ribbon dropped from the mandolin
of a minstrel, three slightly imperfect wassails and
a trencher with a nick on the rim, all that had not
been used of the wild boar at last night&#39;s feast, a
peach-stone like a wrinkled almond nestling in a
sardine tin. Slowly she faced her knight:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Prithee,&#39; she said."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And I am not at all sure that "Uncle Tom&#39;s
Cabin" and "Ivanhoe" wouldn&#39;t have made better
reading if they had lapsed into the photographic at
times. Mr. Lewis may overdo it, but I expect to
re-read "Main Street" some day, and that is more
encouragement than I can hold out to Mrs. Stowe
or Sir Walter Scott.<span class="tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LVI—"EFFECTIVE HOUSE ORGANS"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">To the hurrying commuter as he waits for his
two cents change at the news stand it looks as
if all the periodicals in the United States were on
display there, none of which he ever has quite
time enough to buy. It seems incredible that there
should be presses enough in the country to print
all the matter that he sees hanging from wires, piled
on the counter and dangling from clips over the
edge, to say nothing of his conceiving of there being
other periodicals in circulation which he never even
hears about. But any one knowing the commuter
well enough to call him "dearie" might tell him
in slightly worn vernacular that he doesn&#39;t know
the half of it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">One cannot get a true idea of the amount of sideline
printing that is done in this country without
reading "Effective House Organs," written by
Robert E. Ramsay. The mass effect of this book
is appalling. Page after page of clear-cut illustrations
show reproductions of hundreds and hundreds
of house-organ covers and give the reader a hopeless
<span class="tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sensation of going down for the third time.
Such names as "Gas Logic," "Crane-ing," "Hidden&#39;s
Hints," "The Y. and E. Idea," "Vim,"
"Tick Talk" and "The Smileage" show that
Yankee ingenuity has invaded the publishing field,
which means that the literature of business is on
its way to becoming the literature of the land.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For those who are so illiterate as not to be familiar
with the literature of business, I quote a
definition of the word "house organ":</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A house magazine or bulletin to dealers, customers
or employees, designed to promote goodwill,
increase sales, induce better salesmanship or
develop better profits."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In spite of Mr. Ramsay&#39;s exceedingly thorough
treatment of his subject, there is one type of house
organ to which he devotes much too little space.
This is the so-called "employee or internal house
organ" and is designed to keep the help happy and
contented with their lot and to spur them on to
extra effort in making it a banner year for the
stockholders. The possibilities of this sort of house
organ in the solution of the problem of industrial
unrest are limitless.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Publications for light reading among employees
are usually called by such titles as "Diblee Doings,"
<span class="tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>"Tinkham Topics," "The Mooney and Carmiechal
Machine Lather" or "Better Belting News."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">First of all, they carry news notes of happenings
among the employees, so that a real spirit of cooperation
and team-play may be fostered. These
news notes include such as the following:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Eddie Lingard of the Screen Room force, was
observed last Saturday evening between the mystic
hours of six-thirty with a certain party from the
Shipping Room, said party in a tan knit sweater,
on their way to Ollie&#39;s. Come, &#39;fess up, Eddie!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Everyone is wondering who the person is who
put chocolate peppermints in some of the girls&#39;
pockets while they were hanging in the Girls&#39; Rest
Room Thursday afternoon, it being so hot that
they melted and practically ruined some of their
clothing. Some folks have a funny sense of
humor."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then there are excerpts from speeches made by
the Rev. Charles Aubrey Eaton and young Mr.
Rockefeller or by the President and Treasurer of the
Diamond Motor Sales Corporation, saying, in part:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The man who makes good in any line of work
is the man who gives the best there is in him. He
doesn&#39;t watch the clock. He doesn&#39;t kick when he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fails to get that raise that he may have expected.
He just digs into the job harder and makes the
dust fly. And when some one comes along waving
a red flag and tries to make him stop work and
strike for more money, he turns on the agitator and
says: &#39;You get the h—-- out of here. I know my
job better than you do. I know my boss better
than you do, and I know that he is going to give
me the square deal just as soon as he can see his
way clear to do it. And in the mean time I am
going to WORK!&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That is the kind of man who makes good."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And then there are efficiency contests, with the
force divided into teams trying to see which one
can wrap the most containers or stamp the largest
number of covers in the week. The winning team
gets a felt banner and their names are printed in
full in that week&#39;s issue of "Pep" or "Nosey
News."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And biographies of employees who have been with
the company for more than fifty years, with photographs,
and a little notice written by the Superintendent
saying that this will show the company&#39;s
appreciation of Mr. Gomble&#39;s loyal and unswerving
allegiance to his duty, implying that any one else
who does his duty for fifty years will also get his
<span class="tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>picture in the paper and a notice by the
Superintendent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It will easily be seen how this sort of house
organ can be made to promote good feeling and
esprit de corps among the help. If only more concerns
could be prevailed upon to bring this message
of weekly or monthly good cheer to their employees,
who knows but what the whole caldron of
industrial unrest might not suddenly simmer down
to mere nothingness? It has been said that all that
is necessary is for capital and labor to understand
each other. Certainly such a house organ helps
the employees to understand their employers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Perhaps some one will start a house organ edited
by the employees for circulation among the bosses,
containing newsy notes about the owners&#39; families,
quotations from Karl Marx and the results of the
profit-sharing contest between the various mills of
the district.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This would complete the circle of understanding.<span class="tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LVII—ADVICE TO WRITERS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Two books have emerged from the hundreds
that are being published on the art of writing.
One of them is "The Lure of the Pen," by Flora
Klickmann, and the other is "Learning to Write,"
a collection of Stevenson&#39;s meditations on the subject,
issued by Scribners. At first glance one might
say that the betting would be at least eight to one
on Stevenson. But for real, solid, sensible advice
in the matter of writing and selling stories in the
modern market, Miss Klickmann romps in an easy
winner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It must be admitted that John William Rogers
Jr., who collected the Stevenson material, warns
the reader in his introduction that the book is not
intended to serve as "a macadamized, mile-posted
road to the secret of writing," but simply as a help
to those who want to write and who are interested
to know how Stevenson did it. So we mustn&#39;t compare
it too closely with Miss Klickmann&#39;s book,
which is quite frankly a mile-posted road, with
little sub-headings along the side of the page such
<span class="tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as we used to have in Fiske&#39;s Elementary American
History. But Miss Klickmann will save the editors
of the country a great deal more trouble than
Stevenson&#39;s advice ever will. She is the editor of
an English magazine herself, and has suffered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Where Miss Klickmann enumerates the pitfalls
which the candidate must avoid and points out
qualities which every good piece of writing should
have, Stevenson writes a delightful essay on "The
Profession of Letters" or "A Gossip on Romance."
These essays are very inspiring. They are too
inspiring. They make the reader feel that he can
go out and write like Stevenson. And then a lot
of two-cent stamps are wasted and a lot more editors
are cross when they get home at night.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On the other hand, the result of Miss Klickmann&#39;s
book is to make the reader who feels a
writing spell coming on stop and give pause. He
finds enumerated among the horrors of manuscript-reading
several items which he was on the point
of injecting into his own manuscript with considerable
pride. He may decide that the old job
in the shipping-room isn&#39;t so bad after all, with
its little envelope coming in regularly every week.
As a former member of the local manuscript-readers&#39;
union, I will give one of three rousing cheers
<span class="tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for any good work that Miss Klickmann may do
in this field. One writer kept very busy at work
in the shipping-room every day is a victory for
literature. I used to have a job in a shipping-room
myself, so I know.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If, for instance, the subject under discussion were
that of learning to skate, Miss Klickmann might
advise as follows:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">1. Don&#39;t try to skate if your ankles are weak.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">2. Get skates that fit you. A skate which can&#39;t
be put on when you get to the pond, or one which
drags behind your foot by the strap, is worse than
no skate at all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">3. If you are sure that you are ready, get on your
feet and skate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On the same subject, Scribners might bring to
light something that Stevenson had written to a
young friend about to take his first lesson in
skating, reading as follows:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"To know the secret of skating is, indeed, I
have always thought, the beginning of winter-long
pleasance. It comes as sweet deliverance from the
tedium of indoor isolation and brings exhilaration,
now with a swift glide to the right, now with a
deft swerve to the left, now with a deep breath of
healthy air, now with a long exhalation of ozone,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which the lungs, like greedy misers, have cast aside
after draining it of its treasure. But it is not health
that we love nor exhilaration that we seek, though
we may think so; our design and our sufficient reward
is to verify our own existence, say what you
will.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And so, my dear young friend, I would say to
you: Open up your heart; sing as you skate; sing
inharmoniously if you will, but sing! A man may
skate with all the skill in the world; he may glide
forward with incredible deftness and curve backward
with divine grace, and yet if he be not master
of his emotions as well as of his feet, I would say—and
here Fate steps in—that he has failed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is, of course, plenty of good advice in the
Stevenson book. But it is much better as pure
reading matter than as advice to the young idea or
even the middle-aged idea. It may have been all
right for Stevenson to "play the sedulous ape" and
consciously imitate the style of Hazlitt, Lamb,
Montaigne and the rest, but if the rest of us were
to try it there would result a terrible plague of
insufferably artificial and affected authors, all playing
the sedulous ape and all looking the part.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On the whole, the Stevenson book makes good
reading and Miss Klickmann gives good advice.<span class="tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_87" id="toc_87"></a>
<h1 class="tei tei-head">LVIII—"THE EFFECTIVE SPEAKING VOICE"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Joseph A. Mosher begins his book on "The
Effective Speaking Voice" by saying:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Among the many developments of the great war
was a widespread activity in public speaking."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. Mosher, to adopt a technical term of elocution,
has said a mouthful. Whatever else the war
did for us, it raised overnight an army of public
speakers among the civilian population, many of
whom seem not yet to have received their discharge.
It is the aim of Mr. Mosher&#39;s book to keep this
Landwehr in fighting trim and aid in recruiting its
ranks, possibly against the next war. Until every
nation on earth has subjected its public speakers
to a devastating operation on the larynx no true
disarmament can be said to have taken place.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the first place there are exercises which must
be performed by the man who would have an effective
speaking voice, exercises similar to Walter
Camp&#39;s Daily Dozen. You stand erect, with the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chest held moderately high. (Moderation in all
things is the best rule to follow, no matter what
you are doing.) Place the thumbs just above the
hips, with the fingers forward over the waist to
note the muscular action. Then you inhale and
exhale and make the sound of "ah" and the sound
of "ah-oo-oh," and, if you aren&#39;t self-conscious, you
say "wah-we-wi-wa," slowly, ten or a dozen times.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The student should stop at once if signs of
dizziness appear," says the book, but it does not
say whether the symptoms are to be looked for in
the student himself or in the rest of the family.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The author does the public a rather bad turn
when he suggests to student speakers that, under
stress, they might use what is known as the "orotund."
The orotund quality in public speaking is
saved for passages containing grandeur of thought,
when the orator feels the need of a larger, fuller,
more resonant and sounding voice to be in keeping
with the sentiment. Its effect is somewhat that of
a chant, and here is how you do it:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The chest is raised and tensed, the cavities of the
mouth and pharynx are enlarged, more breath is
directed into the nasal chambers and the lips are
opened more widely to give free passage to the increased
volume of voice.<span class="tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The effectiveness of the orotund might be somewhat
reduced if the audience knew the conscious
mechanical processes which went to make it up. Or
if, in the Congressional Record, instead of (laughter
and applause) the vocal technique of the orator
could be indicated, how few would be the wars into
which impassioned Senators could plunge us! For
example, Mr. Thurston&#39;s plea for intervention in Cuba:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The time for action has come. (Tensing the
chest.) No greater reason for it can exist tomorrow
than exists today. (Enlarging the cavities of the
mouth.) Every hour&#39;s delay only adds another
chapter to the awful story of misery and death.
(Enlarging the cavities of the pharynx.) Only one
power can intervene—the United States of America.
(Directing more breath into the nasal chambers.)
Ours is the one great nation of the New
World—the mother of republics. (Elevating the
diaphragm.) We cannot refuse to accept this responsibility
which the God of the Universe has
placed upon us as the one great power of the New
World. We must act! (Raising the tongue and
thrusting it forward so that the edges of the blade
are pressed against the upper grinders.) What
shall our action be? (Lifting the voice-box very
high and the edges of the tongue blade against the

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LIX—THOSE DANGEROUSLY DYNAMIC BRITISH GIRLS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is difficult to get into Rose Macaulay&#39;s "Dangerous
Ages" once you discover that it is going
to be about another one of those offensively healthy
English families. Ever since "Mr. Britling" we
have been deluged with accounts from overseas of
whole droves of British brothers and sisters, mothers
and fathers, grandfathers and grandmothers, who
all get out at six in the morning and play hockey
all over the place. Each has some strange, intimate
name like "Bim," or "Pleda," or "Goots," and
you can never tell which are the brothers and which
the sisters until they begin to have children along in
the tenth or eleventh chapter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In "Dangerous Ages" they swim. Dozens of
them, all in the same family, go splashing in at
once and persist in calling out health slogans to one
another across the waves. There are <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Neville</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Rodney</span> and <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Gerda</span> and <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Kay</span>, and one or two very
old ladies whose relationship to the rest of the clan
is never very definitely established. Grandma, for
<span class="tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>some reason or other, doesn&#39;t go in swimming that
day, doubtless because she had already been in before
breakfast and her suit wasn&#39;t dry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">These dynamic British girls are always full of
ruddy health and current information. They go
about kidding each other on the second reading of
the Home Rule bill or fooling in their girlish way
about the chances of the Labor candidate in the
coming Duncastershire elections. It is getting so
that no novel of British life will be complete without
somewhere in its pages a scene like the following:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A chance visitor at The Beetles some autumn
morning along about five o&#39;clock might have been
surprised to see a trail of dog-trotting figures winding
their way heatedly across the meadow. No
one but a chance visitor would be surprised, however,
for it was well known to invited guests that
the entire Willetts family ran cross-country down
to the outskirts of London and back every morning
before breakfast, a matter of fourteen miles. In
the lead was, of course, Dungeon in running costume,
followed closely by the flaxen-haired Mid
and snub-nosed Boola, then Arlix and Linny, striving
valiantly for fourth place but not reckoning on
the fleet-footed Meeda, who was no longer content
to hobble in the vanguard with Grandpa Willetts
and Grandpa&#39;s old mother, who still insisted on
<span class="tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cross-country running, although she had long since
been put on the retired list at the Club.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">"Why didn&#39;t you tell us that you were reading a
paper on birth control?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Oh, Linny,&#39; called out Dungeon over her
shoulder, &#39;you young minx! Why didn&#39;t you tell
us that you were reading a paper on Birth Control
at the next meeting of the Spiddix? Twiller just told
me today. It&#39;s too ripping of you!&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Silly goose,&#39; panted Linny, stumbling over a
hedgerow, &#39;how about what the vicar said the other
night about your inferiority complex? It was toppo,
and you know it.&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;It won&#39;t be long now before we&#39;ll have
disenfranchisement through, anyway,&#39; muttered
Grandpa Willetts, crashing down into a stone
quarry, at which exhibition of reaction a loud chorus
of laughter went up from the entire family, who by
this time had reached Nogroton and were bursting
with health."<span class="tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LX—BOOKS AND OTHER THINGS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">For those to whom the purple-and-gold filigreed
covers of Florence L. Barclay&#39;s books bring a
stirring of the sap and a fluttering of the susceptible
heart, "Returned Empty" comes as a languorous
relief from the stolid realism of most present-day
writing. One reads it and swoons. And on opening
one&#39;s eyes again, one hears old family retainers murmuring
in soft retentive accents: "Here, sip some
of this, my lord; &#39;twill bring the roses back to
those cheeks and the strength to those poor limbs."
It&#39;s elegant, that&#39;s all there is to it, elegant.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Returned Empty" was the inscription on the
wrappings which enfolded the tiny but aristocratic
form of a man-child left on the steps of the Foundlings
Institution one moonless October night. There
was also some reference to Luke, xii., 6, which in
return refers to five sparrows sold for two farthings.
What more natural, then, than for the matron to
name the little one Luke Sparrow?<span class="tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Luke was an odd boy but refined. So odd that
he used to go about looking in at people&#39;s windows
when they forgot to pull down the shades, and so
refined that he never wished to be inside with them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But one night, when he was thirty years old, he
looked in at the window of a very refined and elegant
mansion and saw a woman. In the simple
words of the author, "in court or cottage alike she
would be queen." That&#39;s the kind of woman she
was.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And what do you think? She saw Luke looking
in. Not only saw him but came over to the window
and told him that she had been expecting him. Well,
you could have knocked Luke over with a feather.
However, he allowed himself to be ushered in by
the butler (everything in the house was elegant
like that) and up to a room where he found evening
clothes, bath-salts and grand things of that nature.
On passing a box of books which stood in the hall
he read the name on it "before he realized what
he was doing." Of course the minute he thought
what an unrefined thing it was to do he stopped,
but it was too late. He had already seen that his
hostess&#39;s name was "Lady Tintagel."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When later he met her down in the luxurious
dining-room she was just as refined as ever. And
so was he. They both were so refined that she had
<span class="tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to tell the butler to "serve the fruit in the Oak
Room, Thomas."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Once in the Oak Room she told him her strange
tale. It seemed that he was her husband. He didn&#39;t
remember it, but he was. He had been drowned
some years before and she had wished so hard that
he might come back to life that finally he
had been born again in the body of Luke Sparrow.
It&#39;s funny how things work out like that sometimes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Luke, who, as has been said before, was
an odd boy, took it very hard and said that he didn&#39;t
want to be brought back to life. Not even when
she told him that his name was now Sir Nigel Guido
Cadross Tintagel, Bart. He became very cross and
said that he was going out and drown himself all
over again, just to show her that she shouldn&#39;t have
gone meddling with his spirit life. He was too refined
to say so, but when you consider that he was
just thirty, and his wife, owing to the difference in
time between the spirit world and this, had gone on
growing old until she was now pushing sixty, he had
a certain amount of justice on his side. But of
course she was Lady Tintagel, and all the lovers of
Florence Barclay will understand that that is something.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">So, after reciting Tennyson&#39;s "Crossing the Bar,"
<span class="tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at her request (credit is given in the front of the
book for the use of this poem, and only rightly too,
for without it the story could never have been written),
he goes out into the ocean. But there—we
mustn&#39;t give too much of the plot away. All that
one need know is that Luke or Sir Nigel, as you
wish (and what reader of Florence Barclay wouldn&#39;t
prefer Sir Nigel?), was so cultured that he said,
"Nobody in the whole world knows it, save you and
I," and referred to "flotsam and jetson" as he
was swimming out into the path of the rising sun.
"Jetsam" is such an ugly word.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is only fitting that on his tombstone Lady Tintagel
should have had inscribed an impressive and
high-sounding misquotation from the Bible.<span class="tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LXI—"MEASURE YOUR MIND"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Measure Your Mind" by M.R. Traube
and Frank Parker Stockbridge, is apt
to be a very discouraging book if you have any
doubt at all about your own mental capacity. From
a hasty glance through the various tests I figure it
out that I would be classified in Group B, indicating
"Low Average Ability," reserved usually for those
just learning to speak the English language and
preparing for a career of holding a spike while
another man hits it. If they ever adopt the "menti-meter
tests" on this journal I shall last just about
forty-five minutes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And the trouble is that each test starts off so
easily. You begin to think that you are so good
that no one has ever appreciated you. There is for
instance, a series of twenty-four pictures (very
badly drawn too, Mr. Frank Parker Stockbridge.
You think you are so smart, picking flaws with
people&#39;s intelligence. If I couldn&#39;t draw a better
head than the one on page 131 I would throw up
the whole business). At any rate, in each one of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>these pictures there is something wrong (wholly
apart from the drawing). You are supposed to
pick out the incongruous feature, and you have 180
seconds in which to tear the twenty-four pictures
to pieces.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first one is easy. The rabbit has one human
ear. In the second one the woman&#39;s eye is in her
hair. Pretty soft, you say to yourself. In the
third the bird has three legs. It looks like a cinch.
Following in quick succession come a man with his
mouth in his forehead, a horse with cow&#39;s horns, a
mouse with rabbit&#39;s ears, etc. You will have time
for a handspring before your 180 seconds are up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But then they get tricky. There is a post-card
with a stamp upside down. Well, what&#39;s wrong
with that? Certainly there is no affront to nature
in a stamp upside down. Neither is there in a
man&#39;s looking through the large end of a telescope if
he wants to. You can&#39;t arbitrarily say at the top of
the page, "Mark the thing that is wrong," and then
have a picture of a house with one window larger
than all the others and expect any one to agree
with you that it is necessarily <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">wrong</span>. It may look
queer, but so does the whole picture. You can&#39;t
tell; the big window may open from a room
that needs a big window. I am not going to stultify
<span class="tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>myself by making things wrong about which I
know none of the facts. Who am I that I should
condemn a man for looking through the large end
of a telescope? Personally, I like to look through
the large end of a telescope. It only shows the
state of personal liberty in this country when a picture
of a man looking at a ship through the large
end of a telescope is held before the young and
branded as "wrong."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Arguing these points with yourself takes up quite
a bit of time and you get so out of patience with the
man that made up the examination that you lose
all heart in it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then come some pictures about which I am
frankly in the dark. There is a Ford car with a
rather funny-looking mud-guard, but who can pick
out any one feature of a Ford and say that it is
wrong? It may look wrong but I&#39;ll bet that the
car in this picture as it stands could pass many a
big car on a hill.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then there is a boy holding a bat, and while his
position isn&#39;t all that a coach could ask, the only
radically wrong thing that I can detect about the
picture is that he is evidently playing baseball in a
clean white shirt with a necktie and a rather natty
cap set perfectly straight on his head. It is true
<span class="tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he has his right thumb laid along the edge of the
bat, but maybe he likes to bunt that way. There is
something in the picture that I don&#39;t get, I am
afraid, just as there is in the picture of two men
playing golf. One is about to putt. Aside from the
fact that his putter seems just a trifle long, I should
have to give up my guess and take my defeat like
a man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But I do refuse to concede anything on Picture
No. 22. Here a baby is shown sitting on the floor.
He appears to be about a year and a half old. Incidentally,
he is a very plain baby. Strewn about
him on the floor are the toys that he has been playing
with. There are a ball, a rattle, a ring, a doll,
a bell and a pair of roller-skates. Evidently, the
candidate is supposed to be aghast at the roller-skates
in the possession of such a small child.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man who drew that picture had evidently
never furnished playthings for a small child. I can
imagine nothing that would delight a child of a year
and a half more than a pair of roller-skates to chew
and spin and hit himself in the face with. They
could also be dropped on Daddy when Daddy was
lying on the floor in an attempt to be sociable. Of
all the toys arranged before the child, the roller-skates
are the most logical. I suppose that the
author of this test would insist on calling a picture
<span class="tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wrong which showed a baby with a safety-razor in
his hand or an overshoe on his head, and yet a photograph
of the Public Library could not be more true
to life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That is my great trouble in taking tests and examinations
of any kind. I always want to argue
with the examiner, because the examiner is always
so obviously wrong.<span class="tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LXII—THE BROW-ELEVATION IN HUMOR</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">After an author has been dead for some time,
it becomes increasingly difficult for his publishers
to get out a new book by him each year.
Without recourse to the ouija board, Harper &amp;
Brothers manage to do very well by Mark Twain,
considering that all they have to work with are the
books that he wrote when he was alive. Each year
we get something from the pen of the famous humorist,
even though the ink has faded slightly. An
introduction by Albert Bigelow Paine and a hitherto
unpublished photograph as a frontspiece, and there
you are—the season&#39;s new Mark Twain book.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This season it is "Moments With Mark Twain,"
a collection of excerpts from his works for quick
and handy reading. We may look for further books
in this series in 1923, 1924, 1925, &amp;c., to be entitled
"Half Hours With Mark Twain" (the selections
a trifle longer), "Pleasant Week-Ends With Mark
Twain," "Indian Summer With Mark Twain," &amp;c.<span class="tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is an interesting comparison between this
sample bottle of the humor of Mark Twain and that
contained in the volume entitled "Something Else
Again," by Franklin P. Adams. The latter is a volume
of verse and burlesques which have appeared
in the newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the days when Mark Twain was writing, it
was considered good form to spoof not only the
classics but surplus learning of any kind. A man
was popularly known as an affected cuss when he
could handle anything more erudite than a nasal
past participle or two in his own language, and any
one who wanted to qualify as a humorist had to be
able to mispronounce any word of over three syllables.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Thus we find Mark Twain, in the selections given
in this volume, having amusing trouble with the
pronunciation of Michael Angelo and Leonardo da
Vinci, expressing surprise that Michael Angelo was
dead, picking flaws in the old master&#39;s execution
and complaining of the use of foreign words which
have their equivalent "in a nobler language—English."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There certainly is no harm in this school of humor,
and it has its earnest and prosperous exponents today.
In fact, a large majority of the people still
like to have some one poke fun at the things in which
<span class="tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they themselves are not proficient, whether it be
pronunciation, Latin or bricklaying.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But there is an increasingly large section of the
reading public who while they may not be expert
in Latin composition, nevertheless do not think that
a Latin word in itself is a cause for laughter. A
French phrase thrown in now and then for metrical
effect does not strike them as essentially an affectation,
and they are willing to have references made
to characters whose native language may not have
been that noblest of all languages, our native tongue.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That such a school of readers exists is proved by
the popularity of F.P.A&#39;s verses and prose. If
any one had told Mark Twain that a man could run
a daily newspaper column in New York and amass
any degree of fame through translations of the "Odes
of Horace" into the vernacular, the veteran humorist
would probably have slapped Albert Bigelow
Paine on the back and taken the next boat for Bermuda.
And yet in "Something Else Again" we find
some sixteen translations of Horace and other "furriners,"
exotic phrases such as "eheu fugaces" and
"ex parte" used without making faces over them,
and a popular exposition of highly technical verse
forms which James Russell Lowell and Hal Longfellow
would have considered terrifically high-brow.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>And yet thousands of American business men quote
F.P.A. to thousands of other American business
men every morning.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Can it be said that the American people are not so
low-brow as they like to pretend? There is a great
deal of affectation in this homespun frame of mind,
and many a man makes believe that he doesn&#39;t know
things simply because no one has ever written about
them in the American Magazine. If the truth were
known, we are all a great deal better educated than
we will admit, and the derisive laughter with which
we greet signs of culture is sometimes very hollow.
In F.P.A. we find a combination which makes it
possible for us to admit our learning and still be
held honorable men. It is a good sign that his following
is increasing.<span class="tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">LXIII—BUSINESS LETTERS</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">A text-book on English composition, giving
examples of good and bad letter-writing, is
always a mine of possibilities for one given to ruminating
and with nothing in particular to do. In
"Business Man&#39;s English" the specimen letters are
unusually interesting. It seems almost as if the
authors, Wallace Edgar Bartholomew and Floyd
Hurlbut, had selected their examples with a view to
their fiction possibilities. It also seems to the reader
as if he were opening someone else&#39;s mail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For instance, the following is given as a type of
"very short letter, well placed":</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">

<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. Richard T. Green,<br />
Employment Department,<br />
Travellers&#39; Insurance Co.,<br />
Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Green:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The young man about whom you inquire has
much native ability and while in our employ proved
himself a master of office routine.<span class="tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I regret to say, however, that he left us under
circumstances that would not justify our recommending
him to you.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Cordially yours,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">C.S. THOMPSON</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now I want to know what those "circumstances"
were. And in lieu of the facts, I am afraid that I
shall have to imagine some circumstances for myself.
Personally, I don&#39;t believe that the "young man"
was to blame. Bad companions, maybe, or I
shouldn&#39;t be at all surprised if he was shielding
someone else, perhaps a young lady stenographer
with whom he was in love. The more I think of it
the more I am sure that this was the secret of the
whole thing. You see, he was a good worker and
had, Mr. Thompson admits, proved himself a master
of office routine. Although Mr. Thompson doesn&#39;t
say so, I have no doubt but that he would have been
promoted very shortly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And then he fell in love with a little brown-eyed
stenographer. You know how it is yourself. She
had an invalid mother at home and was probably
trying to save enough money to send her father to
college. And whatever she did, it couldn&#39;t have
been so very bad, for she was such a nice girl.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Well, at any rate, it looks to me as if the young
man, while he was arranging the pads of paper for
<span class="tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the regular Monday morning conference, overheard
the office-manager telling about this affair (I have
good reason to believe that it was a matter of carelessness
in the payroll) and saying that he considered
the little brown-eyed girl dishonest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At this the young man drew himself up to his
full height and, looking the office-manager squarely
in the eye, said:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, Mr. Hostetter; it was I who did it, and I
will take the consequences. And I want it understood
that no finger of suspicion shall be pointed
at Agnes Fairchild, than whom no truer, sweeter
girl ever lived!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am sorry to hear this, Ralph," said Mr. Hostetter.
"You know what this means."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I do, sir," said Ralph, and turned to look out
over the chimney-pots of the city, biting his under
lip very tight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And on Saturday Ralph left.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Since then he has applied at countless places for
work, but always they have written to his old employer,
Mr. Thompson, for a reference, and have
received a letter similar to the one given here as an
example. Naturally, they have not felt like taking
him on. You cannot blame them. And, in a way,
you cannot blame Mr. Thompson. You see, Mr.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Hostetter didn&#39;t tell Mr. Thompson all the circumstances
of the affair. He just said that Ralph had
confessed to responsibility for the payroll mix-up.
If Mr. Thompson had been there at the time I am
sure that he would have divined that Ralph was
shielding Miss Fairchild, for Mr. Thompson liked
Ralph. You can see that from his letter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But as it stands now things are pretty black for
the boy, and it certainly seems as if in this great
city there ought to be some one who will give him
a job without writing to Mr. Thompson about him.
This department will be open as a clearing-house for
offers of work for a young man of great native ability
and master of office routine who is just at present,
unfortunately, unable to give any references,
but who will, I am quite sure, justify any trust that
may be placed in him in the future.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
